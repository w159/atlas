# HubSpot Pipeline Summary

Generate a summary of the HubSpot deal pipeline showing deals per stage, total and weighted values, and upcoming close dates. Provides a quick overview of sales health and revenue forecast.

## Prerequisites

- HubSpot MCP server connected with valid OAuth credentials
- MCP tools `hubspot_search_deals` and `hubspot_access_associations` available

## Steps

1. **Fetch all open deals** in the pipeline

   Call `hubspot_search_deals` with filters:
   - Exclude `closedwon` and `closedlost` stages
   - If a pipeline is specified, filter by `pipeline`
   - If an owner is specified, filter by `hubspot_owner_id`
   - If a period is specified, filter by `closedate` range
   - Set `limit=100` and paginate through all results

2. **Fetch closed-won deals** for the period (if period filter is set)

   Call `hubspot_search_deals` with `dealstage=closedwon` and the period filter to get won deals.

3. **Group deals by stage** and calculate metrics

   For each stage:
   - Count of deals
   - Total value (sum of amounts)
   - Weighted value (total * stage probability)
   - Average deal size
   - Nearest close date

4. **Calculate pipeline totals**

   - Total pipeline value
   - Total weighted forecast
   - Average deal size
   - Total deals
   - Won revenue (if period filter)

5. **Format and present the summary**

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| pipeline | string | No | default | Pipeline to summarize |
| owner | string | No | all | Filter by deal owner |
| period | string | No | all | Close date period (this_month, this_quarter, this_year, all) |
