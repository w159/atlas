2. **Preview message(s) before release**
   - Call `proofpoint_quarantine_preview` for each message
   - Display sender, recipient, subject, and quarantine reason
   - Show threat scores if available

3. **Confirm release action**
   - Display warning if message has high threat scores
   - Require explicit confirmation for malware-quarantined messages
   - Skip confirmation if `--confirm` flag is set

4. **Execute release**
   - For single message: call `proofpoint_quarantine_release`
   - For bulk release: call `proofpoint_quarantine_bulk_release`

5. **Report results**
   - Confirm successful releases
