# Investigate Threat

Perform a deep-dive investigation of a specific threat, campaign, or suspicious indicator using Proofpoint TAP, threat intelligence, and forensics data.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Proofpoint service principal and secret configured
- TAP API and Forensics API access
- Threat intelligence access for campaign details

## Steps

1. **Resolve the investigation target**
   - If `threat-id`: Look up threat directly
   - If `campaign-id`: Look up campaign and all associated threats
   - If `message-guid`: Look up the message and extract threat IDs
   - If `url`: Analyze the URL and find associated threats

2. **Gather threat context**
   - Call `proofpoint_threat_get_campaign` if a campaign ID is available
   - Call `proofpoint_threat_get_indicators` for IOCs
   - Call `proofpoint_forensics_get_report` if forensics are requested

3. **Assess impact**
   - Query TAP for all messages containing this threat
   - Identify all affected recipients
   - Check click data for any user interaction

4. **Build investigation report**
   - Compile threat details, campaign context, and IOCs
   - List affected users and click activity
   - Provide remediation recommendations

5. **Suggest remediation**
   - Recommend search-and-destroy for delivered threats
   - Suggest password resets for clicked phishing
   - Provide IOCs for blocklist updates

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| threat-id | string | No* | - | Proofpoint threat ID |
| campaign-id | string | No* | - | Campaign identifier |
| message-guid | string | No* | - | Message GUID |
| url | string | No* | - | Suspicious URL |
| include-forensics | boolean | No | true | Include sandbox data |

*At least one of `threat-id`, `campaign-id`, `message-guid`, or `url` is required.

## Examples

### Investigate by Threat ID

```
/investigate-threat --threat-id "abc123def456"
```

### Investigate a Campaign

```
/investigate-threat --campaign-id "camp-789xyz"
```

### Investigate a Message

```
/investigate-threat --message-guid "msg-guid-abc123"
```

### Investigate a URL

```
/investigate-threat --url "https://suspicious-domain.com/login"
```

### Quick Investigation (No Forensics)

```
/investigate-threat --threat-id "abc123def456" --include-forensics false
```
