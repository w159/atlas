# Pax8 License Summary

Generate an aggregated license summary across all client companies. Shows per-client license counts, costs, and identifies optimization opportunities such as unused licenses, cost savings from annual commitments, and consolidation recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Pax8 MCP server connected with a valid MCP token
- MCP tools `pax8-list-companies`, `pax8-list-subscriptions`, `pax8-get-product-by-uuid`, and `pax8-get-product-pricing-by-uuid` available

## Steps

1. **Fetch all companies**

   Call `pax8-list-companies` with `size=200`, `sort=name`, `order=asc`. Paginate through all pages if needed.

2. **For each company, fetch active subscriptions**

   Call `pax8-list-subscriptions` with `companyId` set to the company UUID, `status=Active`, and `size=200`. Paginate if needed.

3. **Resolve product names** for each unique product ID

   Call `pax8-get-product-by-uuid` with `productId` for each unique product found across all subscriptions. Cache results to avoid duplicate lookups.

4. **Optionally fetch pricing** for margin analysis

   Call `pax8-get-product-pricing-by-uuid` with `productId` to get `partnerBuyPrice` and `suggestedRetailPrice`.

5. **Aggregate data** by company, product, and vendor

6. **Analyze for optimization opportunities**
   - Monthly subscriptions that could save money on annual terms
   - Companies with very low seat counts (potential consolidation)
   - Upcoming renewals that need review
   - Products with high per-seat costs relative to alternatives

7. **Format and return** the comprehensive summary

## Parameters

   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+--------+---------+
   Potential Total Savings: $3,816/year

2. LOW SEAT COUNT SUBSCRIPTIONS
   These subscriptions have very few seats and may be unused:

   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+---------+
   | Company                    | Product                     | Qty  | Monthly |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+---------+
   | Harbor Consulting          | Exchange Online Plan 2      | 1    | $7.20   |
   | Lakewood Partners          | Microsoft Teams Essentials  | 2    | $7.20   |
   | Cedar Grove Realty          | Acronis Cyber Protect       | 1    | $12.00  |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+---------+
   Action: Verify these licenses are in use. Cancel if unused.

3. UPCOMING RENEWALS (next 30 days)
   Review these subscriptions before auto-renewal:

   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+-----------+----------+
   | Company                    | Product                     | Qty  | Monthly   | Renews   |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+-----------+----------+
   | Enterprise Holdings        | M365 E3                     | 200  | $6,300.00 | 2026-03-15|
   | TechStart Inc              | SentinelOne Control         | 80   | $360.00   | 2026-03-20|
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------+------+-----------+----------+
   Action: Review seat counts and pricing before renewal.

4. PRODUCT CONSOLIDATION
   Multiple companies have overlapping security products:

   - 5 companies have both Microsoft Defender AND SentinelOne
     Consider standardizing on one endpoint security platform.

   - 3 companies have Exchange Online Plan 1 + Microsoft 365 (which includes Exchange)
     Exchange Online may be redundant if M365 licenses are sufficient.

Total Potential Monthly Savings: $543.00
Total Potential Annual Savings: $6,516.00
