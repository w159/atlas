# Huntress Plugin

Claude Code plugin for the Huntress managed threat detection and response platform.

## Overview

This plugin provides Claude with deep knowledge of Huntress, enabling:

- **Incident Management** - Triage, investigate, and resolve incidents with remediation workflows
- **Escalation Handling** - Review and resolve security escalations from Huntress SOC
- **Endpoint Agent Management** - Monitor agent health and inventory across organizations
- **Organization Management** - CRUD operations for MSP client organizations
- **Billing & Reporting** - Generate billing and summary reports for client invoicing
- **Security Signals** - Monitor and investigate security signals across the fleet

## Prerequisites

### API Credentials

Huntress authenticates via HTTP Basic Auth using an API key and secret:

1. Log into the [Huntress Dashboard](https://dashboard.huntress.io)
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Credentials**
3. Generate an API key and secret pair

### Environment Variables

```bash
export HUNTRESS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export HUNTRESS_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HUNTRESS_API_KEY` | Yes | | API key from Settings > API Credentials |
| `HUNTRESS_API_SECRET` | Yes | | API secret from Settings > API Credentials |
| `HUNTRESS_MCP_URL` | No | `https://mcp.wyre.ai/v1/huntress/mcp` | MCP server URL — override to use a self-hosted gateway |

## Self-Hosted Gateway

If you run the [mcp-gateway](https://github.com/wyre-technology/mcp-gateway), set `HUNTRESS_MCP_URL` to your gateway's endpoint:

```
HUNTRESS_MCP_URL=https://your-gateway-domain/v1/huntress/mcp
```

**Setting env vars in Claude.ai:** Go to your org → Settings → Integrations → Huntress → Configure and add the variable.

**Setting env vars in Claude Code:** Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "HUNTRESS_MCP_URL": "https://your-gateway-domain/v1/huntress/mcp"
  }
}
```

## Installation

### Via MCP Gateway (Recommended)

Use the [MCP Gateway](https://mcp.wyre.ai) to connect — paste your API key and secret and you're done.

### Self-Hosted (Docker)

Run the Huntress MCP server via Docker with the MCP Gateway self-hosted option. See the [MCP Gateway documentation](https://mcp.wyre.ai) for setup instructions.

### Claude Code CLI

Add the `.mcp.json` from this plugin to your project and set the environment variables:

```bash
export HUNTRESS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export HUNTRESS_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `api-patterns` | Authentication, API structure, pagination, rate limiting, error handling |
| `agents` | Endpoint agent management, listing, filtering, and health monitoring |
| `organizations` | CRUD operations for organizations and key-based management |
| `incidents` | Incident lifecycle — triage, investigation, resolution, and remediations |
| `escalations` | Escalation management — review and resolve SOC escalations |
| `billing` | Billing and summary reports for MSP client reporting |
| `signals` | Security signals monitoring and investigation |

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/incident-triage` | Triage open incidents by severity |
| `/investigate-incident` | Deep dive into a specific incident with remediations |
| `/org-health` | Organization health check (agents, incidents, escalations) |
| `/agent-inventory` | List and filter agents across organizations |
| `/billing-report` | Generate billing summary for a period |
| `/resolve-escalation` | Review and resolve an escalation |

## Quick Start

### Triage Open Incidents

```
/incident-triage
```

### Investigate a Specific Incident

```
/investigate-incident --incident_id "12345"
```

### Check Organization Health

```
/org-health --organization_id "67890"
```

### Generate Billing Report

```
/billing-report
```

## Security Considerations

### Credential Handling

- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Rotate API credentials periodically via the Huntress Dashboard
- Use the minimum scope necessary for your use case
- Monitor API usage in the Huntress audit log

### HTTP Transport Security

If using the MCP server over HTTP transport, ensure:
- TLS termination via a reverse proxy
- Restrict access to trusted networks
- Use authentication at the proxy layer

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you see "401 Unauthorized":
1. Verify `HUNTRESS_API_KEY` and `HUNTRESS_API_SECRET` are set correctly
2. Check that the API credentials have not been revoked
3. Regenerate credentials at Huntress Dashboard > Settings > API Credentials

### Rate Limits

Huntress enforces a rate limit of 60 requests per minute:
1. Space out requests when iterating over large datasets
2. Use pagination to limit result sizes
3. If rate limited (HTTP 429), wait before retrying

### Connection Issues

If the MCP server fails to connect:
1. Verify network connectivity to `https://mcp.wyre.ai`
2. Check that your API credentials are valid
3. Ensure the MCP Gateway service is running
