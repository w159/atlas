# Huntress Incidents

Manage Huntress SOC-confirmed security incidents across client organizations. Query open incidents, review SOC-recommended remediations, approve or reject remediation actions, and resolve incidents once all remediations are processed.

## API Tools

### List Incidents

Retrieve incidents filtered by organization and status.

```python
huntress_incidents_list(organization_id='org-456', status='open', page_token=None)
# Returns: {"incidents": [...], "next_page_token": "abc123" | null}
```

Each incident object contains `id`, `title`, `severity`, `status`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `affected_hosts`, and `remediations_count`.

### Get Incident Details

```python
huntress_incidents_get(incident_id='inc-789')
# Returns: full incident with investigation details, indicators, timeline, and affected hosts
```

### List Remediations for an Incident

```python
huntress_incidents_remediations(incident_id='inc-789')
# Returns: {"remediations": [{"id": "rem-001", "type": "scheduled_task_removal", "description": "Remove malicious scheduled task 'WindowsUpdate'", "status": "pending", "host": "ACME-WS-042"}, ...]}
```

Each remediation has a `status` field: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `executing`, `completed`, or `failed`.

### Get Remediation Details

```python
huntress_incidents_remediation_get(incident_id='inc-789', remediation_id='rem-001')
# Returns: single remediation with full execution details and host context
```

### Bulk Approve Remediations

```python
huntress_incidents_bulk_approve(incident_id='inc-789', remediation_ids=['rem-001', 'rem-002'])
# Returns: per-remediation success/failure status
```

### Bulk Reject Remediations

```python
huntress_incidents_bulk_reject(incident_id='inc-789', remediation_ids=['rem-003'], reason='False positive - legitimate admin tool')
# Returns: per-remediation success/failure status
```

### Resolve Incident

```python
huntress_incidents_resolve(incident_id='inc-789')
# Fails if any remediations are still pending — approve or reject all first
```

## Workflows

### Daily Incident Triage

1. Fetch open incidents: `huntress_incidents_list(status='open')`
2. Page through results if `next_page_token` is returned
3. Sort by severity (critical > high > low), then group by `organization_id`
4. For each critical incident, call `huntress_incidents_get(incident_id=...)` to review investigation details
5. Proceed to remediation review for actionable incidents

### Incident Investigation and Remediation

1. Get full details: `huntress_incidents_get(incident_id='inc-789')`
2. List remediations: `huntress_incidents_remediations(incident_id='inc-789')`
3. Review each remediation's `type`, `description`, and `host` before approving
4. Approve safe remediations or reject with a documented reason
5. Resolve: `huntress_incidents_resolve(incident_id='inc-789')`

### Bulk Remediation with Validation

Use this workflow when an incident has multiple pending remediations.

1. **List and verify**: Call `huntress_incidents_remediations(incident_id='inc-789')` and confirm all target remediations have `status: 'pending'` — skip any already processed
2. **Separate by action**: Split remediation IDs into approve and reject lists after reviewing each action
3. **Approve batch**: `huntress_incidents_bulk_approve(incident_id='inc-789', remediation_ids=['rem-001', 'rem-002'])`
4. **Check results**: Inspect the per-remediation response — some may fail (already processed, host offline). Retry or escalate failures individually
5. **Reject remaining**: `huntress_incidents_bulk_reject(incident_id='inc-789', remediation_ids=['rem-003'], reason='...')`
6. **Verify completion**: Re-fetch `huntress_incidents_remediations(incident_id='inc-789')` and confirm no remediations remain `pending` before resolving
7. **Resolve**: `huntress_incidents_resolve(incident_id='inc-789')`

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Incident not found | Invalid ID or deleted incident | Re-list incidents to get correct IDs |
| Remediation already processed | Approve/reject on non-pending remediation | Check `status` before processing; filter to `pending` only |
| Cannot resolve with pending remediations | Unprocessed remediations remain | Approve or reject all remediations first |

## Best Practices

- **Filter before fetching**: Always pass `organization_id` and `status` to `huntress_incidents_list` to reduce response size and avoid unnecessary pagination
- **Verify remediation status before bulk operations**: Re-fetch remediations and filter to `status: 'pending'` immediately before calling bulk approve/reject to avoid already-processed errors
- **Always provide rejection reasons**: The `reason` parameter on `huntress_incidents_bulk_reject` creates an audit trail — use specific, actionable reasons (e.g., "Legitimate admin tool — verified with client IT")
- **Cross-reference with escalations**: Call the escalations skill to check if related escalations exist before resolving an incident
