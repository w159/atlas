- Contact (if specified) must exist in HubSpot

## Steps

1. **Resolve company** - Find the company by name or use the provided ID

   - If a name was provided, call `hubspot_search_companies` with `name` filter using `CONTAINS_TOKEN`
   - If an ID was provided, call `hubspot_retrieve_company` with `companyId`
   - Confirm the company exists before proceeding

2. **Resolve contact** (if specified) - Find the contact by name or use the provided ID

   - If a name was provided, call `hubspot_search_contacts` with `firstname` and `lastname` filters
   - If an ID was provided, call `hubspot_retrieve_contact` with `contactId`

3. **Create the deal** with the provided properties

   - `amount`: The deal amount
   - `dealstage`: The pipeline stage
   - `pipeline`: The pipeline ID
   - `closedate`: The expected close date
   - `dealtype`: `newbusiness` (default)

4. **Associate with company** - Link the deal to the company

   Call `hubspot_create_association` with `fromObjectType=deal`, `toObjectType=company`, `associationType=deal_to_company`

5. **Associate with contact** (if specified) - Link the deal to the contact

   Call `hubspot_create_association` with `fromObjectType=deal`, `toObjectType=contact`, `associationType=deal_to_contact`

6. **Log creation note** - Document the deal creation

   Call `hubspot_create_note` with a summary of the deal and associate it with the deal

7. **Present deal summary** for confirmation
