# Check Payment Status

Check payment status and outstanding balances for a managed services client in Xero.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Xero OAuth2 credentials configured (`XERO_CLIENT_ID`, `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- Xero tenant ID configured (`XERO_TENANT_ID`)
- OAuth scopes `accounting.contacts.read` and `accounting.transactions.read` granted

## Steps

1. **Authenticate with Xero**

   ```bash
   ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://identity.xero.com/connect/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -u "${XERO_CLIENT_ID}:${XERO_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounting.contacts.read accounting.transactions.read" \
     | jq -r '.access_token')
   ```

2. **Find the contact**

   ```bash
   CONTACT=$(curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts?where=Name.Contains(%22${CONTACT_NAME}%22)" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json")

   CONTACT_ID=$(echo $CONTACT | jq -r '.Contacts[0].ContactID')
   CONTACT_DISPLAY=$(echo $CONTACT | jq -r '.Contacts[0].Name')
   ```

3. **Fetch outstanding invoices**

   ```bash
   # Outstanding invoices (unpaid)
   curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices?where=Contact.ContactID==guid(%22${CONTACT_ID}%22)&&Type==%22ACCREC%22&&Status==%22AUTHORISED%22" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

4. **Fetch recent payments**

   ```bash
   curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Payments?where=Invoice.Contact.ContactID==guid(%22${CONTACT_ID}%22)&&PaymentType==%22ACCRECPAYMENT%22" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

5. **Calculate aging and compile results**

6. **Format and return summary**
