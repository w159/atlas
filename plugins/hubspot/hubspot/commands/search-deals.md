# Search HubSpot Deals

Search for deals in HubSpot CRM by name, pipeline stage, company, or amount. Returns matching deals with pipeline position, value, and close date information.

## Prerequisites

- HubSpot MCP server connected with valid OAuth credentials
- MCP tools `hubspot_search_deals`, `hubspot_retrieve_deal`, and `hubspot_search_companies` available

## Steps

1. **Build search filters** based on the user's parameters

   - If a query is provided, search `dealname` using `CONTAINS_TOKEN`
   - If a stage is provided, filter by `dealstage` using `EQ`
   - If a company is provided, first find the company ID with `hubspot_search_companies`, then use `hubspot_access_associations` to find deals, or filter by associated company
   - If amount filters are provided, add `GT`/`LT` filters on `amount`

2. **Execute the search** using `hubspot_search_deals`

   Call `hubspot_search_deals` with the constructed `filterGroups`, `limit=100`, sorted by `amount` descending.

3. **Enrich results** with company names if not already included

   For each deal, optionally call `hubspot_access_associations` to get the associated company name.

4. **Format and return results** with deal details
