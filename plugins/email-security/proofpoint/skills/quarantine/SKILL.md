# Proofpoint Quarantine Management

## Overview

Proofpoint quarantine holds messages that have been identified as threats, spam, or policy violations. The quarantine API allows administrators to search, preview, release, and delete quarantined messages. This is a critical workflow for MSP help desk teams who need to respond to "missing email" requests from end users.

Quarantine operates at two levels:
- **Admin quarantine** - Managed by administrators, holds threats and policy violations
- **End-user quarantine** - Self-service spam quarantine with digests

## Key Concepts

### Quarantine Reasons

| Reason | Description | Default Retention |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| `spam` | Message scored above spam threshold | 30 days |
| `phish` | Message identified as phishing | 30 days |
| `malware` | Message contained malware | 30 days |
| `impostor` | Message flagged as BEC/impostor | 30 days |
| `bulk` | Bulk/marketing email | 14 days |
| `adult` | Adult content filter match | 30 days |
| `policy` | Custom policy rule match | Configurable |
| `dmarc` | Failed DMARC authentication | 30 days |
| `dkim` | Failed DKIM verification | 30 days |
| `spf` | Failed SPF check | 30 days |

### Quarantine Folders

| Folder | Contents | Release Allowed |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| `quarantine` | Admin quarantine (threats, policy) | Admin only |
| `spam` | End-user spam quarantine | End-user or admin |

### Message States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `quarantined` | Message is held in quarantine |
| `released` | Message was released to recipient |
| `deleted` | Message was permanently deleted |
| `expired` | Message exceeded retention period and was removed |

## Field Reference

| `phishScore` | int | Phishing confidence score |
| `malwareScore` | int | Malware confidence score |
| `impostorScore` | int | Impostor/BEC confidence score |

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `sender` | string | Filter by sender address (exact or partial) |
| `recipient` | string | Filter by recipient address |
| `subject` | string | Filter by subject (substring match) |
| `startDate` | datetime | Start of date range |
| `endDate` | datetime | End of date range |
| `reason` | string | Filter by quarantine reason |
| `folder` | string | Filter by quarantine folder |
| `limit` | int | Maximum results (default 25, max 500) |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description | Key Parameters |

| `proofpoint_quarantine_list` | List recent quarantined messages | `folder`, `limit`, `offset` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_get` | Get details of a specific quarantined message | `id` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_preview` | Preview message content without releasing | `id` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_release` | Release message to original recipient | `id`, `recipient` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_delete` | Permanently delete quarantined message | `id` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_bulk_release` | Release multiple messages at once | `ids[]` |
| `proofpoint_quarantine_bulk_delete` | Delete multiple messages at once | `ids[]` |

## Common Workflows

### User Reports Missing Email

1. Get the sender and approximate time from the user
2. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_search` with `recipient=<user>` and `sender=<expected_sender>` and appropriate date range
3. If found, call `proofpoint_quarantine_preview` to verify the message is legitimate
4. If legitimate, call `proofpoint_quarantine_release` to deliver the message
5. If the sender is consistently quarantined, consider adding a safe sender policy

### Daily Quarantine Review

1. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_list` with `folder=quarantine` and `limit=100`
2. Review messages grouped by reason
3. Release any false positives
4. Delete confirmed threats
5. Note recurring senders for blocklist consideration

### Bulk Release for Known-Good Sender

1. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_search` with `sender=<known_good_sender>`
2. Collect all message IDs from results
3. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_bulk_release` with the collected IDs
4. Recommend adding the sender to the organization's safe sender list

### Investigate Quarantine Spike

1. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_search` with a narrow time window
2. Group results by `reason` to identify what type of messages increased
3. Group by `sender` to identify if a single source is responsible
4. Cross-reference with TAP data using message GUIDs
5. Determine if this is a targeted attack or spam campaign

### Clean Up Expired Threats

1. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_search` with `reason=malware` and date range > 14 days
2. Review any remaining malware-quarantined messages
3. Call `proofpoint_quarantine_bulk_delete` to remove confirmed threats
4. Document any messages that were released for audit trail

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid date range | Ensure startDate is before endDate |
| 400 | Invalid folder | Use `quarantine`, `spam`, or `bulk` |
| 401 | Authentication failed | Verify service principal and secret |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | Ensure quarantine management is enabled |
| 404 | Message not found | Message may have expired or been deleted |
| 409 | Message already released | Message was already released by another admin |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Implement backoff; limit bulk operations |

### Release Failures

If a release fails:
- The message may have been deleted or expired
- The recipient mailbox may be full or invalid
- The downstream mail server may be rejecting delivery
- Check the message ID is correct and the message still exists in quarantine

### Search Returning Too Many Results

- Narrow the date range
- Add more specific filters (sender + recipient + subject)
- Use pagination with `limit` and `offset`
- Filter by specific quarantine reason

## Best Practices

1. **Preview before release** - Always preview a message before releasing to verify it is legitimate
2. **Document releases** - Keep a log of released messages for audit purposes
3. **Use bulk operations carefully** - Bulk release should only be used for verified false positives
4. **Monitor quarantine volume** - Spikes may indicate a targeted attack or misconfigured policy
5. **Set up digests** - Enable end-user quarantine digests to reduce help desk load
6. **Review retention policies** - Ensure quarantine retention matches your compliance requirements
7. **Never release confirmed threats** - If a message is confirmed malware or phishing, delete it
8. **Cross-reference with TAP** - Use the GUID to check TAP threat data before releasing
9. **Safe sender lists** - For recurring false positives, add the sender to the safe sender list rather than releasing each time
10. **Train users** - Educate users on checking their quarantine digest before contacting the help desk
