# Search HubSpot Contacts

Search for contacts in HubSpot CRM by name, email address, or company name. Returns matching contacts with key details and associated records.

## Prerequisites

- HubSpot MCP server connected with valid OAuth credentials
- MCP tools `hubspot_search_contacts`, `hubspot_retrieve_contact`, and `hubspot_list_contact_properties` available

## Steps

1. **Build search filters** based on the user's query

   Determine which field(s) to search:
   - If the query contains `@`, search by `email` using `CONTAINS_TOKEN`
   - If a specific field is requested, search that field
   - Otherwise, search by `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email` across multiple filter groups

2. **Execute the search** using `hubspot_search_contacts`

   Call `hubspot_search_contacts` with the constructed `filterGroups`, `limit=100`, and sort by `lastname` ascending.

3. **Optionally filter by lifecycle stage**

   If a lifecycle stage filter is provided, add it to the filter groups.

4. **Format and return results** with contact details

   For each matching contact, display name, email, phone, company, lifecycle stage, and last activity date.

| query | string | Yes | - | Search term (name, email, or company) |
