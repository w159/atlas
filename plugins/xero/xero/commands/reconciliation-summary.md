# Reconciliation Summary

Verify all MSP clients have been billed for a given period and produce a reconciliation summary. This command helps MSPs ensure no client has been missed during monthly billing runs.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Xero OAuth2 credentials configured (`XERO_CLIENT_ID`, `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- Xero tenant ID configured (`XERO_TENANT_ID`)
- OAuth scopes `accounting.contacts.read`, `accounting.transactions.read`, and `accounting.reports.read` granted

## Steps

1. **Authenticate with Xero**

   ```bash
   ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://identity.xero.com/connect/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -u "${XERO_CLIENT_ID}:${XERO_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounting.contacts.read accounting.transactions.read accounting.reports.read" \
     | jq -r '.access_token')
   ```

2. **Fetch all active customers**

   ```bash
   curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts?where=ContactStatus==%22ACTIVE%22&&IsCustomer==true&page=1" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

3. **Fetch invoices for the billing period**

   ```bash
   # Get all sales invoices for the period
   YEAR=$(echo ${PERIOD} | cut -d- -f1)
   MONTH=$(echo ${PERIOD} | cut -d- -f2)

   curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices?where=Type==%22ACCREC%22&&Date>=DateTime(${YEAR},${MONTH},1)&&Date<=DateTime(${YEAR},${MONTH},28)&&Status!=%22DELETED%22&&Status!=%22VOIDED%22&page=1" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

4. **Cross-reference customers against invoices**
   - Identify customers with no invoice for the period
   - Identify customers with invoices
   - Flag any anomalies (unusual amounts, missing line items)

5. **Fetch Aged Receivables for context**

   ```bash
   curl -s -X GET "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Reports/AgedReceivablesByContact?date=${YEAR}-${MONTH}-28" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
     -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

6. **Compile and format reconciliation report**

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| period | string | No | Current month | Billing period (YYYY-MM) |
| contact_group | string | No | - | Filter by contact group name |
| account_code | string | No | - | Filter by revenue account code |

## Error Handling

### Authentication Failed

```
Error: OAuth2 token request failed

Resolution:
  - Verify XERO_CLIENT_ID and XERO_CLIENT_SECRET
  - Re-authorize the Custom Connection in Xero Developer Portal
```

### No Active Customers

```
Warning: No active customers found in Xero

Possible causes:
  - No contacts with IsCustomer=true
  - All contacts are archived
  - Wrong tenant ID

Resolution:
  - Verify XERO_TENANT_ID is correct
  - Check that contacts exist with customer invoices
```

### Rate Limited

```
Error: Rate limit exceeded (429)

This command makes multiple API calls (contacts, invoices, reports).
Wait 60 seconds and retry. Consider running during off-peak hours
for large client bases.
```

### Invalid Period

```
Error: Invalid period format "March 2026"

Expected format: YYYY-MM (e.g., "2026-03")

Example:
  /reconciliation-summary --period "2026-03"
```

## API Calls Made

This command makes the following API calls:

| Call | Endpoint | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `POST /connect/token` | Authenticate |
| 2+ | `GET /Contacts?page=N` | Fetch active customers (paginated) |
| 3+ | `GET /Invoices?page=N` | Fetch period invoices (paginated) |
| 4 | `GET /Reports/AgedReceivablesByContact` | Aged receivables context |

For an MSP with 20 clients, this typically requires 4-5 API calls (well within the 60/minute limit).

## Use Cases

Run after generating monthly invoices to confirm completeness:

```
# After batch invoice creation
/reconciliation-summary --period "2026-03"
```

### Monthly Financial Review

Part of the monthly close process:

```
/reconciliation-summary --period "2026-03"
# Review unbilled clients and overdue balances
# Take action on flagged items
```

### Quarterly Business Review

```
/reconciliation-summary --period "2026-01"
/reconciliation-summary --period "2026-02"
/reconciliation-summary --period "2026-03"
```

### New Client Verification

```
