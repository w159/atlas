# Log Activity in HubSpot

Log a note or create a follow-up task on a HubSpot contact, company, or deal. Ensures all client interactions are documented in the CRM.

## Prerequisites

- HubSpot MCP server connected with valid OAuth credentials
- MCP tools `hubspot_create_note`, `hubspot_create_task`, `hubspot_create_association`, and search tools available
- At least one object (contact, company, or deal) must be specified for association

## Steps

1. **Resolve associated objects** - Find the contact, company, and/or deal

   For each specified object:
   - If a name was provided, search using the appropriate search tool
   - If an ID was provided, retrieve the object directly

2. **Create the activity** based on the type

   **For notes:**

   - Set `hs_timestamp` to the current time

   **For tasks:**
   - Call `hubspot_create_task` with `hs_task_subject` set to a summary and `hs_task_body` set to the full content
   - Set `hs_task_priority` to the specified priority
   - Set `hs_timestamp` to the due date

3. **Associate with objects** - Link the activity to all specified objects

   For each resolved object, call `hubspot_create_association` to link the note or task.

4. **Confirm the activity** was created and associated
