# Change Sherweb Subscription Quantity

Change the seat or license quantity on a subscription for a customer. Specify the new total quantity (not a delta). The change is applied immediately or enters a pending state depending on the vendor.

## Prerequisites

- Subscription must be in `Active` state
- New quantity must be within the product's minimum/maximum limits

## Steps

1. **Resolve customer** - Find the customer by name or ID

   - If a name was provided, call `sherweb_customers_list` with `search` set to the customer name
   - If an ID was provided, call `sherweb_customers_get` with `customerId`

2. **Resolve subscription** - Find the subscription by ID or product name

   - If a subscription ID was provided, call `sherweb_subscriptions_get` with `subscriptionId`
   - If a product name was provided, call `sherweb_subscriptions_list` with `customerId` and `status=Active`, then find the subscription matching the product name

3. **Validate the change**

   - Verify the subscription is in `Active` state
   - Verify the new quantity is different from the current quantity
   - Verify the new quantity is greater than 0

4. **Present change summary** for user confirmation

   Show: customer name, product, current quantity, new quantity, and any warnings about commitment terms

5. **Execute the quantity change**

   Call `sherweb_subscriptions_change_quantity` with:
   - `subscriptionId` set to the resolved subscription ID
   - `quantity` set to the new total quantity

6. **Verify the change**

   Call `sherweb_subscriptions_get` with the `subscriptionId` to confirm the new quantity is applied
