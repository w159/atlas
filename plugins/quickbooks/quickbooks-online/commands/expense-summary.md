```

|-------|-------------|
| customer | Group by allocated customer (default) |
| vendor | Group by vendor/payee |
| category | Group by expense account/category |

## Error Handling

### Invalid Date Range

```
Invalid date range: start date must be before end date.

Provided: from 2026-03-01, to 2026-02-01

Fix: Ensure --from is earlier than --to

Example:
  /expense-summary --from 2026-02-01 --to 2026-03-01
```

### Customer Not Found

```
No customer matching "XYZ Corp" found.

Suggestions:
  - Check spelling: /search-customers "XYZ"
  - Remove filter to see all expenses: /expense-summary
```

### API Error

```
Error fetching expense data from QuickBooks Online

Possible causes:
  - Expired access token (check QBO_ACCESS_TOKEN)
  - Invalid realm ID (check QBO_REALM_ID)
  - Network connectivity issue

Resolution:
  1. Refresh the access token
  2. Verify environment variables
  3. Retry the command
```

## Use Cases

### Monthly Cost Review

Review all expenses for the past month:
```
/expense-summary --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-01-31
```

### Client Profitability Check

Compare costs against revenue for a specific client:
```
/expense-summary --customer "Acme Corp"
```
Then compare with: `/get-balance --customer "Acme Corp"`

### Vendor Spend Analysis

Identify top vendors to negotiate better rates:
```
/expense-summary --group_by vendor --from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-12-31
```

### License Cost Allocation

Verify all software licenses are allocated to clients:
```
/expense-summary --group_by customer
```
Check the "Unallocated" row for costs not assigned to clients.

### Pre-Invoice Verification

```
/expense-summary --customer "Acme Corp" --from 2026-02-01 --to 2026-02-28
```
