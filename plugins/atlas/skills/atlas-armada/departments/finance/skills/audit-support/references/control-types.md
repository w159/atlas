# Common Control Types

Reference for the control types encountered in SOX 404 testing: IT
general controls, manual controls, automated controls, IT-dependent
manual controls, and entity-level controls. Each entry lists examples
and the testing approach.

## IT General Controls (ITGCs)

Controls over the IT environment that support the reliable functioning of
application controls and automated processes.

**Access Controls:**
- User access provisioning (new access requests require approval)
- User access de-provisioning (terminated users removed timely)
- Privileged access management (admin/superuser access restricted and
  monitored)
- Periodic access reviews (user access recertified on a defined schedule)
- Password policies (complexity, rotation, lockout)
- Segregation of duties enforcement (conflicting access prevented)

**Change Management:**
- Change requests documented and approved before implementation
- Changes tested in a non-production environment before promotion
- Separation of development and production environments
- Emergency change procedures (documented, approved post-implementation)
- Change review and post-implementation validation

**IT Operations:**
- Batch job monitoring and exception handling
- Backup and recovery procedures (regular backups, tested restores)
- System availability and performance monitoring
- Incident management and escalation procedures
- Disaster recovery planning and testing

## Manual Controls

Controls performed by people using judgment, typically involving review
and approval.

**Examples:**
- Management review of financial statements and key metrics
- Supervisory approval of journal entries above a threshold
- Three-way match verification (PO, receipt, invoice)
- Account reconciliation preparation and review
- Physical inventory observation and count
- Vendor master data change approval
- Customer credit approval

**Key attributes to test:**
- Was the control performed by the right person (proper authority)?
- Was it performed timely (within the required timeframe)?
- Is there evidence of the review (signature, initials, email, system
  log)?
- Did the reviewer have sufficient information to perform an effective
  review?
- Were exceptions identified and appropriately addressed?

## Automated Controls

Controls enforced by IT systems without human intervention.

**Examples:**
- System-enforced approval workflows (cannot proceed without required
  approvals)
- Three-way match automation (system blocks payment if PO/receipt/invoice
  do not match)
- Duplicate payment detection (system flags or blocks duplicate
  invoices)
- Credit limit enforcement (system prevents orders exceeding credit
  limit)
- Automated calculations (depreciation, amortization, interest, tax)
- System-enforced segregation of duties (conflicting roles prevented)
- Input validation controls (required fields, format checks, range
  checks)
- Automated reconciliation matching

**Testing approach:**
- Test design: Confirm the system configuration enforces the control as
  intended
- Test operating effectiveness: For automated controls, if the system
  configuration has not changed, one test of the control is typically
  sufficient for the period (supplemented by ITGC testing of change
  management)
- Verify change management ITGCs are effective (if system changed,
  re-test the control)

## IT-Dependent Manual Controls

Manual controls that rely on the completeness and accuracy of
system-generated information.

**Examples:**
- Management review of a system-generated exception report
- Supervisor review of a system-generated aging report to assess
  reserves
- Reconciliation using system-generated trial balance data
- Approval of transactions identified by a system-generated workflow

**Testing approach:**
- Test the manual control (review, approval, follow-up on exceptions)
- AND test the completeness and accuracy of the underlying report/data
  (IPE - Information Produced by the Entity)
- IPE testing confirms the data the reviewer relied on was complete and
  accurate

## Entity-Level Controls

Broad controls that operate at the organizational level and affect
multiple processes.

**Examples:**
- Tone at the top / code of conduct
- Risk assessment process
- Audit committee oversight of financial reporting
- Internal audit function and activities
- Fraud risk assessment and anti-fraud programs
- Whistleblower/ethics hotline
- Management monitoring of control effectiveness
- Financial reporting competence (staffing, training, qualifications)
- Period-end financial reporting process (close procedures, GAAP
  compliance reviews)

**Significance:**
- Entity-level controls can mitigate but typically cannot replace
  process-level controls
- Ineffective entity-level controls (especially audit committee oversight
  and tone at the top) are strong indicators of a material weakness
- Effective entity-level controls may reduce the extent of testing needed
  for process-level controls
