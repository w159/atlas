# SentinelOne Cloud Security Posture Review

Review cloud security posture across managed client environments. Lists misconfigurations grouped by severity, identifies compliance gaps against industry standards (CIS, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA), and provides remediation guidance for the most critical findings. Useful for compliance audits, QBR security reporting, and cloud hardening initiatives.

## Prerequisites

- SentinelOne Purple MCP server connected with a valid Service User token
- MCP tools `list_misconfigurations`, `search_misconfigurations`, and `get_misconfiguration` available
- Token must be Account or Site level (NOT Global)

## Steps

1. **Fetch misconfigurations**

   Call `list_misconfigurations` with the specified `severity` filter, `viewType`, and `limit`. Sort by severity descending.

2. **Count by severity**

   Aggregate results to show counts of CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW misconfigurations.

3. **Identify compliance gaps**

   Group misconfigurations by compliance standard to show which standards have the most open findings.

4. **Break down by client**

   Group by site (client) to show which clients have the worst posture.

5. **Highlight critical findings with remediation**

   For CRITICAL and HIGH findings, include the remediation steps and evidence details.

6. **Provide posture improvement recommendations**

   Prioritize remediation based on severity, compliance impact, and exploit potential.

   MITRE:      T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage
   Remediation:
     1. Navigate to S3 > acme-backup-2026 > Permissions
     2. Enable "Block all public access"

```

### No Data

```
SentinelOne Cloud Security Posture Review
================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-24
Domain:    KUBERNETES

No Kubernetes misconfigurations found.

Possible reasons:
  - No Kubernetes clusters connected to SentinelOne
  - Kubernetes security scanning not enabled
  - Service User token may lack CSPM access

Suggestions:
  - Check SentinelOne Console > Cloud Security for connector status
  - Try a different domain: /posture-review --view_type CLOUD
