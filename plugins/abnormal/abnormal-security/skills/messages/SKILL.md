# Abnormal Security Message Analysis

## Overview

Abnormal Security provides deep message analysis capabilities beyond basic threat detection. This skill covers message retrieval, header inspection, attachment analysis, sender authentication results, and delivery context. Use it when performing forensic analysis of specific emails or investigating delivery patterns.

| `isInternal` | boolean | Whether the email is internal (within org) |
| `isExternal` | boolean | Whether the email is from outside the org |
| `remediationStatus` | string | Current remediation status |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description | Key Parameters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `abnormal_messages_get` | Get full message details | `threatId`, `abxMessageId` |
| `abnormal_messages_list` | List messages for a threat | `threatId` |
| `abnormal_messages_headers` | Get raw email headers | `threatId`, `abxMessageId` |

### Tool Usage Examples

**Get message details:**
```json
{
  "tool": "abnormal_messages_get",
  "parameters": {
    "threatId": "184def76-3c28-4e1b-9ef0-a5abc123def4",
    "abxMessageId": 987654321
  }
}
```

**List messages associated with a threat:**
```json
{
  "tool": "abnormal_messages_list",
  "parameters": {
    "threatId": "184def76-3c28-4e1b-9ef0-a5abc123def4"
  }
}
```

## Message Analysis Workflows

### Header Analysis Workflow

1. **Retrieve message headers** - Get raw headers for detailed inspection
2. **Check authentication:**
   - SPF: Does the sending IP match the domain's SPF record?
   - DKIM: Is the DKIM signature valid and aligned?
   - DMARC: Does the message pass DMARC policy?
3. **Trace routing:**
   - Follow Received headers from bottom to top
   - Identify mail servers and relay hops
   - Check for unusual routing or delays
4. **Inspect key headers:**
   - From vs Return-Path mismatch (potential spoofing)
   - Reply-To vs From mismatch (redirect replies)
   - X-Mailer or User-Agent (sending client)
   - Content-Type and encoding

### Attachment Analysis Workflow

1. **List attachments** - Review filenames, types, and sizes
2. **Check for suspicious patterns:**
   - Double extensions (e.g., `invoice.pdf.exe`)
   - Macro-enabled Office files (`.docm`, `.xlsm`)
   - Archive files (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`) containing executables
   - Unusual MIME types
3. **Cross-reference with threat data:**
   - Check if the attachment hash matches known malware
   - Review sandbox analysis results if available
4. **Assess risk:**
   - Was the attachment opened by the recipient?
   - How many users received the same attachment?

### Sender Reputation Workflow

1. **Check sender identity:**
   - Is this a first-time sender to this recipient?
   - Does the display name match the email address?
   - Is the domain recently registered?
2. **Verify authentication:**
   - SPF, DKIM, DMARC all passing?
   - Are there any authentication failures?
3. **Check sender IP:**
   - Is the IP on any blocklists?
   - Does it match the expected mail server for the domain?
4. **Review communication history:**
   - Has this sender contacted the organization before?
   - Is the communication pattern normal?

## Authentication Results Reference

### SPF Results

| Result | Meaning | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| `pass` | Sending IP authorized by domain | Low |
| `softfail` | IP not authorized but not explicitly denied | Medium |
| `fail` | IP explicitly not authorized | High |
| `neutral` | No SPF assertion | Medium |
| `none` | No SPF record exists | Medium |

### DKIM Results

| Result | Meaning | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| `pass` | Valid DKIM signature, aligned | Low |
| `fail` | DKIM signature invalid | High |
| `none` | No DKIM signature present | Medium |

### DMARC Results

| Result | Meaning | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| `pass` | Passes DMARC policy (SPF or DKIM aligned) | Low |
| `fail` | Fails DMARC policy | High |
| `none` | No DMARC record exists | Medium |

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid message ID | Verify abxMessageId is a valid long integer |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API token |
| 404 | Message not found | Message may have been purged or threat ID is wrong |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait and retry |

## Best Practices

1. **Always check authentication** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures are strong spoofing indicators
2. **Compare From and Return-Path** - Mismatches often indicate spoofing or forwarding
3. **Review Reply-To** - Reply-To different from From is a common BEC indicator
4. **Check attachment types carefully** - Not all dangerous files have obvious extensions
5. **Trace Received headers** - Follow the email routing path for anomalies
6. **Check if email was read** - Read emails with credential phishing need password resets
7. **Cross-reference with threats** - Message context enriches threat investigations
