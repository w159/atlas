What made the incident worse or delayed our response? (monitoring gaps, escalation delays, missing runbooks, etc.)

At least 2-3 things the team did right during the response.

Specific tasks to prevent recurrence or improve response time. For each: description, owner (assign to [YOUR NAME] if unspecified), and a due date 2 weeks from today.
