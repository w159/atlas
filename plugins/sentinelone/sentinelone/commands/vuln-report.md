# SentinelOne Vulnerability Report

Generate a vulnerability summary report across managed client environments. Shows vulnerability counts by severity, top CVEs ranked by EPSS score, exploit maturity breakdown, and per-client vulnerability exposure. Useful for patch prioritization, QBR preparation, and compliance reporting.

## Prerequisites

- SentinelOne Purple MCP server connected with a valid Service User token
- MCP tools `list_vulnerabilities`, `search_vulnerabilities`, and `get_vulnerability` available
- Token must be Account or Site level (NOT Global)

## Steps

1. **Fetch vulnerabilities**

   Call `list_vulnerabilities` with the specified `status` filter, sorted by EPSS score descending. If a `severity` filter is provided, include it. Use the specified `limit`.

2. **Count by severity**

   Aggregate results to show counts of CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW vulnerabilities.

3. **Identify top CVEs by EPSS score**

   Sort vulnerabilities by EPSS score descending and present the top entries with CVE ID, CVSS score, EPSS score, exploit maturity, and affected client.

4. **Break down by exploit maturity**

   Count vulnerabilities by exploit maturity: ACTIVE, WEAPONIZED, POC, NONE.

5. **Aggregate by client**

   Group vulnerabilities by site (client) to show which clients are most exposed.

6. **Provide patch prioritization recommendations**

   Recommend patching order based on EPSS score and exploit maturity.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| severity | string | No | all | Filter by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) |
| status | string | No | NEW | Filter by status (NEW, IN_PROGRESS, TO_BE_PATCHED, RESOLVED, etc.) |
| limit | integer | No | 50 | Maximum number of vulnerabilities to return |

## Examples
