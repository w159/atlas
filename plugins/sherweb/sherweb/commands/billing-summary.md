# Sherweb Billing Summary

View payable charges for a billing period with detailed pricing breakdown including list prices, net prices, deductions, fees, and taxes. Useful for monthly reconciliation, margin analysis, and cost reporting.

## Prerequisites

- Sherweb MCP server connected with valid credentials
- MCP tools `sherweb_billing_get_billing_periods`, `sherweb_billing_get_payable_charges`, and `sherweb_customers_list` available

## Steps

1. **Resolve billing period** - Find the target billing period

   - If "latest" or no period specified, call `sherweb_billing_get_billing_periods` with `pageSize=1` to get the most recent period
   - If a specific period ID was provided, use it directly

2. **Fetch payable charges** for the billing period

   Call `sherweb_billing_get_payable_charges` with:
   - `billingPeriodId` set to the resolved period ID
   - `pageSize=100` for maximum results per page
   - Paginate through all pages if needed

3. **Filter results** if customer or charge type filters were specified

   - If a customer name was provided, call `sherweb_customers_list` with `search` to resolve the customer ID, then filter charges by `customerId`
   - If a charge type was specified (not "all"), filter charges by `chargeType`

4. **Calculate summary totals** from the charges

   - Sum `subTotal`, `deductions`, `fees`, `taxes`, and `total` across all matching charges
   - Group by customer for per-customer breakdowns
   - Group by charge type for category breakdowns

5. **Format and return** the billing summary with pricing details
