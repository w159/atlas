# Checkpoint Harmony Email Quarantine Management

## Overview

Checkpoint Harmony Email & Collaboration (Avanan) quarantines emails that match security policies before they reach the end user's inbox. The quarantine system is the primary interface for reviewing flagged emails, releasing false positives, and managing email flow. This skill covers comprehensive quarantine management including search, review, release workflows, bulk operations, and quarantine configuration.

## Quarantine Reasons

Emails are quarantined based on the detection engine that flagged them:

| Reason Code | Name | Description | Typical Action |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **PHISHING** | Phishing | Suspected phishing attempt | Review sender, URLs, release if legitimate |
| **MALWARE** | Malware | Malicious attachment or link detected | Almost never release; escalate to incident |
| **SPAM** | Spam | Bulk or unsolicited email | Release if legitimate business email |
| **DLP** | Data Loss Prevention | Outbound email violates DLP policy | Review content, release if authorized |
| **BEC** | Business Email Compromise | Impersonation or fraud attempt | Investigate thoroughly before any release |
| **ANOMALY** | Anomaly Detection | Unusual sender behavior detected | Compare against known sender patterns |
| **POLICY** | Policy Violation | Custom policy rule triggered | Check which policy matched, release if appropriate |
| **BULK** | Bulk Mail | Marketing or newsletter content | Release if subscribed/wanted |

### Severity Mapping

| Severity | Quarantine Reasons | Auto-Release Eligible |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Critical | MALWARE, BEC | No - requires manual review |
| High | PHISHING | No - requires manual review |
| Medium | DLP, ANOMALY, POLICY | Configurable per policy |
| Low | SPAM, BULK | Yes - if admin configured |

### Tool Usage Examples

**List recent quarantined emails:**
```json
{
  "tool": "avanan_quarantine_list",
  "parameters": {
    "startDate": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2024-02-15T23:59:59Z",
    "status": "QUARANTINED",
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

**Search by sender:**
```json
{
  "tool": "avanan_quarantine_search",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "suspicious@external-domain.com",
    "field": "sender",
    "startDate": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Release with allow-list:**
```json
{
  "tool": "avanan_quarantine_release",
  "parameters": {
    "entityIds": ["qe-abc123", "qe-def456"],
    "releaseToRecipients": true,
    "addToAllowList": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

### False Positive Review Workflow

1. **User reports missing email** - Check quarantine for the expected message
2. **Search quarantine** by sender address and date range
3. **Review quarantine entry** - Check reason, confidence, severity
4. **Verify legitimacy:**
   - Compare sender address vs display name (BEC indicator)
   - Check if sender is known/expected
   - Review attachment types and URL destinations
   - Check confidence level of detection
5. **Release if legitimate:**
   - Release to original recipients
   - Optionally add sender to allow list
   - Document the false positive for policy tuning
6. **If suspicious** - Escalate to incident investigation

### Bulk Quarantine Review Workflow

1. **List quarantined emails** for the review period (e.g., last 24 hours)
2. **Group by quarantine reason** to prioritize review
3. **Review SPAM/BULK first** - highest false positive rate
4. **Review POLICY matches** - check if policy is too broad
5. **Review PHISHING/BEC last** - most likely true positives
6. **Bulk release** confirmed false positives
7. **Bulk delete** confirmed threats

### Quarantine Expiry Management

Quarantined emails auto-delete after the configured retention period (default: 30 days).

```
Day 1-7:   Email in quarantine, available for review
Day 8-14:  Email still available, notification sent to admin
Day 15-30: Email nearing expiry
Day 30+:   Email permanently deleted
```

**To extend retention:** Release and re-quarantine, or export before expiry.

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid date range | Ensure startDate is before endDate, max 90-day range |
| 400 | Invalid entity ID | Verify the quarantine entity ID exists |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API credentials and token expiry |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | API key needs quarantine management scope |
| 404 | Quarantine entry not found | Entry may have expired or been deleted |
| 409 | Already released | Email was already released from quarantine |
| 429 | Rate limited | Implement exponential backoff |

### Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Date range too wide | Exceeds 90-day maximum | Narrow the date range |
| Too many entity IDs | Bulk operation exceeds 100 items | Split into smaller batches |
| Invalid reason filter | Unrecognized quarantine reason | Use valid reason codes from reference above |
| Expired entry | Quarantine retention period passed | Entry cannot be recovered |

## Best Practices

1. **Review quarantine daily** - Prevents legitimate emails from expiring undelivered
2. **Start with low-severity items** - SPAM/BULK have highest false positive rates
3. **Never release MALWARE without investigation** - Even if the user requests it
4. **Use allow lists judiciously** - Over-broad allow lists weaken security posture
5. **Document release decisions** - Helps tune policies and track patterns
6. **Monitor quarantine volume trends** - Sudden spikes may indicate a targeted attack
7. **Batch operations for efficiency** - Use bulk release/delete for large review sets
8. **Check sender display name vs address** - Mismatches are a strong BEC indicator
