# ImmyBot Software Search

Search the ImmyBot software catalog before configuring a deployment, to confirm a publisher / version exists and is the canonical entry to target.

## Prerequisites

- ImmyBot MCP server connected with valid `IMMYBOT_INSTANCE_SUBDOMAIN`, `IMMYBOT_TENANT_ID`, `IMMYBOT_CLIENT_ID`, `IMMYBOT_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Tools available: `immybot_software_search`, `immybot_software_get`, `immybot_software_versions`, `immybot_software_latest_version`

## Steps

1. **Search the catalog**

   Call `immybot_software_search` with `query`.

2. **Drill into the candidate**

   For each result, optionally call `immybot_software_get` for full detail.

3. **List versions**

   For the chosen software, call `immybot_software_versions` and `immybot_software_latest_version` so the operator can pick a pinned version or track latest.

4. **Output**

   - Top matches (name, publisher, software ID)
   - For each: latest version, total versions available
   - Suggested next step: pass the software ID to a deployment workflow
