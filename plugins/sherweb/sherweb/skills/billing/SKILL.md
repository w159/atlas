# Sherweb Distributor Billing

## Overview

Billing in Sherweb represents the financial data flowing from the distributor to the service provider (MSP). When Sherweb provisions or manages cloud subscriptions on behalf of an MSP's customers, it generates payable charges that roll up into billing periods. Each charge includes detailed pricing breakdown with list prices, net prices, proration, deductions (promotional and performance), fees, and taxes. Understanding Sherweb billing data is critical for MSPs to calculate margins, reconcile invoices, and ensure accurate client billing.

## MCP Tools

## Key Concepts

### Charge Types

Sherweb categorizes charges into three types:

| Charge Type | Description | When Generated |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `Setup` | One-time provisioning or activation fees | When a new subscription is created |
| `Recurring` | Ongoing subscription charges | Each billing cycle (monthly/yearly) |
| `Usage` | Consumption-based charges (e.g., Azure metered) | Based on actual usage during the period |

### Billing Cycles

| Cycle | Description | Charge Frequency |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `OneTime` | Single charge, no recurrence | Once at setup |
| `Monthly` | Charged every month | Monthly billing period |
| `Yearly` | Charged annually | Annual billing period |

### Pricing Breakdown

Every charge in Sherweb includes a detailed pricing structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `listPrice` | decimal | Vendor's published list price per unit |
| `netPrice` | decimal | Partner's net price after distributor discounts |
| `quantity` | integer | Number of units (seats, licenses, etc.) |
| `prorated` | boolean | Whether the charge is prorated for a partial period |
| `proratedDays` | integer | Number of days in the prorated period |
| `subTotal` | decimal | Calculated subtotal before deductions (netPrice x quantity) |

### Deductions

Sherweb applies deductions to reduce the partner's cost. Deductions come in three types:

| Deduction Type | Description | Calculation |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `PromotionalMoney` | Fixed dollar amount promotional discount | Subtracted from subTotal |
| `PromotionalPercentage` | Percentage-based promotional discount | Percentage off subTotal |
| `PerformancePercentage` | Performance-based rebate for hitting volume targets | Percentage off subTotal |

### Fees and Taxes

After deductions, additional line items may apply:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `fees` | Administrative or platform fees added by Sherweb |
| `taxes` | Applicable sales tax, GST, HST, or VAT |
| `total` | Final amount payable (subTotal - deductions + fees + taxes) |

### MSP Margin Calculation

To calculate your MSP margin on a Sherweb charge:

```
MSP Cost     = charge.total (what you pay Sherweb)
Client Price = your retail price to the customer
Margin       = Client Price - MSP Cost
Margin %     = (Margin / Client Price) * 100
```

**Tips for margin analysis:**

1. Compare `listPrice` vs `netPrice` to see your distributor discount
2. Factor in deductions -- promotional discounts reduce your cost
3. Performance percentage deductions reward volume; track these quarterly
4. Setup charges are one-time -- amortize across the subscription term for accurate monthly margin
5. Usage charges fluctuate -- use historical averages for margin forecasting

## Common Workflows

### Monthly Billing Reconciliation

1. Call `sherweb_billing_get_billing_periods` to find the current or most recent closed period
2. Call `sherweb_billing_get_payable_charges` with the `billingPeriodId`, paginating through all results
3. Group charges by `customerId` to see per-customer totals
4. Compare Sherweb charges against what you bill each customer in your PSA
5. Flag discrepancies where MSP cost exceeds or is too close to client billing

### Margin Analysis Across Customers

1. Fetch all payable charges for the billing period
2. For each customer, sum the `total` field across all charges
3. Compare against your retail billing to that customer
4. Calculate margin per customer and overall portfolio margin
5. Identify customers with negative or sub-target margins

### Deduction Tracking

1. Fetch payable charges and filter for entries with non-empty `deductions` arrays
2. Group deductions by type (PromotionalMoney, PromotionalPercentage, PerformancePercentage)
3. Sum total savings from each deduction category
4. Track performance percentage deductions over time to monitor volume rebate trends

### Invoice Verification

1. Call `sherweb_billing_get_invoices` to list recent invoices
2. For each invoice, call `sherweb_billing_get_invoice_details` with the `invoiceId`
3. Cross-reference invoice line items with payable charges from the billing period
4. Verify totals match and flag any discrepancies

### Cost Forecasting

1. Pull 3-6 months of historical billing periods
2. For each period, get all payable charges
3. Calculate average monthly cost per customer and per product
4. Identify trends (growing seat counts, new products, usage spikes)
5. Project next month's Sherweb costs for budget planning

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Billing period not found | Invalid `billingPeriodId` | List available periods with `sherweb_billing_get_billing_periods` |
| No charges found | Period has no charges or wrong period selected | Verify the billing period dates cover the expected range |
| Charge details unavailable | Charge ID does not exist | Verify the charge ID from the payable charges list |
| Invoice not found | Invalid `invoiceId` | List invoices with `sherweb_billing_get_invoices` |
| Authentication error | Expired or invalid token | Re-authenticate using OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow |

## Best Practices

1. **Reconcile monthly** - Compare Sherweb charges against your PSA billing every month to catch discrepancies early
2. **Track deductions** - Monitor promotional and performance deductions to ensure you receive expected discounts
3. **Watch for proration** - Prorated charges indicate mid-cycle changes; verify they match subscription modifications
4. **Separate charge types** - Analyze Setup, Recurring, and Usage charges independently for accurate cost modeling
5. **Calculate true margin** - Include fees and taxes in margin calculations, not just netPrice vs listPrice
6. **Archive billing data** - Export billing period data for historical analysis and audit trails
7. **Monitor usage charges** - Usage-based charges (Azure, etc.) can spike unexpectedly; set up alerts
8. **Verify invoice totals** - Always cross-reference invoices against payable charge totals
9. **Plan for billing cycles** - Annual charges create cash flow events; plan for yearly renewal months
10. **Use performance rebates strategically** - Consolidate purchasing through Sherweb to maximize performance percentage deductions
