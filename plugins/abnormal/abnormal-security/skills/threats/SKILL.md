# Abnormal Security Threat Detection & Analysis

## Overview

Abnormal Security uses behavioral AI to detect email threats that bypass traditional secure email gateways (SEGs). Unlike signature or rule-based detection, Abnormal profiles normal communication patterns and detects deviations indicative of attacks. This skill covers threat types, attack vectors, severity assessment, remediation, and investigation workflows.

## Threat Types

| Type | Description | Severity Range |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **BEC (Business Email Compromise)** | Impersonation of executives or trusted contacts to request financial actions | High - Critical |
| **Credential Phishing** | Emails designed to harvest credentials via fake login pages | Medium - Critical |
| **Malware** | Emails containing malicious attachments or links to malware downloads | High - Critical |
| **Extortion** | Threatening emails demanding payment (sextortion, DDoS threats) | Medium - High |
| **Social Engineering** | Manipulation attacks using urgency, authority, or trust | Medium - Critical |
| **Spam** | Unsolicited bulk email | Low |
| **Graymail** | Marketing, newsletters, and promotional content | Low |
| **Scam** | Advance-fee fraud, fake invoices, lottery scams | Medium - High |
| **Supply Chain Compromise** | Attacks from compromised vendor or partner email accounts | Critical |

### Detection Approach

| Engine | Description | What It Detects |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Behavioral AI** | Models normal communication patterns per user/org | BEC, social engineering, impersonation |
| **Content Analysis** | NLP analysis of email body and intent | Urgency, financial requests, credential harvesting |
| **Sender Profiling** | Reputation and authentication of sender | Spoofing, domain impersonation, first-time senders |
| **URL Analysis** | Real-time scanning of embedded links | Credential phishing pages, malware delivery |
| **Attachment Analysis** | File inspection and sandboxing | Malware, ransomware payloads |
| **VendorBase** | Vendor risk intelligence network | Supply chain compromise, compromised vendor accounts |

    "fromDate": "2026-03-20T00:00:00Z",
    "toDate": "2026-03-27T00:00:00Z",
    "pageSize": 25
  }
}
```

**Get threat details:**
```json
{
  "tool": "abnormal_threats_get",
  "parameters": {
    "threatId": "184def76-3c28-4e1b-9ef0-a5abc123def4"
  }
}
```

**Remediate a threat:**
```json
{

    "threatId": "184def76-3c28-4e1b-9ef0-a5abc123def4",
    "action": "QUARANTINE"
  }
}
```

## Threat Investigation Workflows

### BEC Investigation Workflow

1. **Review threat details** - Check attackType, attackStrategy, summaryInsights
2. **Analyze impersonation:**
   - Who is being impersonated (impersonatedParty)
   - Display name vs actual email address mismatch
   - Reply-to vs from address mismatch
   - First-time sender or unusual communication pattern
3. **Check financial indicators:**
   - Wire transfer, ACH, or gift card requests
   - Invoice or payment redirection
   - Urgency language ("urgent", "today", "confidential")
4. **Assess scope:**
   - Search for same sender across all recipients
   - Check if other users received similar attacks
5. **Remediate:**
   - Quarantine message if still in inbox
   - Alert targeted recipients directly
   - Block sender domain if confirmed malicious
6. **Document** - Record findings and IOCs

### Credential Phishing Investigation Workflow

1. **Get threat details** - Focus on attackVector and embedded URLs
2. **Analyze URLs:**
   - Check for brand impersonation (Microsoft, Google, Dropbox)
   - Look for redirect chains and URL shorteners
   - Identify credential harvesting pages
3. **Check sender authentication:**
   - SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
   - Domain age and reputation
4. **Assess user interaction:**
   - Was the email read (isRead)?
   - Was it post-remediated (delivered then removed)?
5. **Remediate:**
   - Quarantine all instances
   - Force password reset if credentials may have been entered
   - Block phishing domain

### Malware Investigation Workflow

1. **Get attachment details** - File name, type, size
2. **Review AI insights** - Check summaryInsights for behavioral indicators
3. **Assess delivery:**
   - Was the attachment opened?
   - How many users received the same attachment?
4. **Remediate:**
   - Quarantine all instances across the organization
   - Block file hash at endpoint level
   - Isolate affected endpoints if attachment was executed

## Severity Assessment Matrix

| Factor | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|--------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Attack Type | Spam, Graymail | Scam, Extortion | Phishing, BEC | Supply Chain, ATO |
| Recipients | 1 user | 2-10 users | 10-50 users | 50+ or executives |
| User Interaction | Not read | Read, no click | Link clicked | Credentials entered |
| Sender Profile | Known spam | Unknown external | Impersonation | Compromised internal |
| Financial Impact | None | Low value request | Wire/ACH request | Active fraud |

## Remediation Actions

| Action | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `QUARANTINE` | Move to quarantine (user cannot access) | Confirmed malicious threats |
| `MOVE_TO_JUNK` | Move to junk/spam folder | Spam, graymail, low-confidence threats |
| `DELETE` | Permanently delete the message | High-severity confirmed threats |
| `UNREMEDIATE` | Undo remediation, restore to inbox | False positives |

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid filter parameter | Check filter syntax and valid field names |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API token validity |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | Token needs threat detection scope |
| 404 | Threat not found | Verify threat ID |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait and retry with exponential backoff |

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize by attack type** - BEC and supply chain threats first
2. **Check user interaction** - Prioritize threats that were read or clicked
3. **Review AI insights** - summaryInsights explains why Abnormal flagged the email
4. **Correlate with account takeover** - A phishing campaign may lead to account compromise
5. **Monitor remediation status** - Ensure auto-remediation is working as expected
6. **Track post-remediation** - Emails remediated after delivery need immediate attention
7. **Never release confirmed threats** - Even if users request it; escalate to management
