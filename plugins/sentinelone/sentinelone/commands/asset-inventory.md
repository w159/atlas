# SentinelOne Asset Inventory

Generate an asset inventory summary for managed client environments. Lists assets by surface type (endpoints, cloud resources, identities, network-discovered devices) with counts per client, health status, and coverage metrics. Useful for agent deployment tracking, QBR preparation, and unmanaged device identification.

## Prerequisites

- SentinelOne Purple MCP server connected with a valid Service User token
- MCP tools `list_inventory_items` and `search_inventory_items` available
- Token must be Account or Site level (NOT Global)

## Steps

1. **Fetch inventory items**

   Call `list_inventory_items` with the specified `surface` filter. Paginate through all results using `offset` and `limit`.

2. **Aggregate by client**

   Group inventory items by `siteName` (client) and count per client.

3. **Summarize by type/status**

   For endpoints: count by OS type, agent status, and machine type.
   For cloud: count by cloud provider and resource type.
   For identities: count by identity provider and MFA status.
   For network discovery: count by managed vs. unmanaged.

4. **Identify health issues**

   Flag disconnected agents, outdated agent versions, unmanaged devices, and accounts without MFA.

5. **Present inventory summary**

   Show totals, per-client breakdown, and health recommendations.

## Parameters

(More clients with fewer endpoints omitted)

Health Issues:
  1. 18 INACTIVE agents - installed but not communicating
     Top affected: Global Services (4), Acme Corp (3)
  2. 12 DISCONNECTED agents - lost connection to console
     Top affected: Global Services (4), Acme Corp (2)
  3. 23 endpoints with outdated agent versions
     Recommendation: Schedule agent upgrades during next maintenance window

Recommended Actions:
  1. Investigate disconnected agents -- may indicate endpoints offline or decommissioned
  2. Reactivate inactive agents or remove decommissioned endpoints
  3. Schedule agent version upgrades for 23 outdated endpoints
  4. Check for unmanaged devices: /asset-inventory --surface NETWORK_DISCOVERY

```

### Empty Inventory

```
SentinelOne Asset Inventory - Cloud
================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-24
Surface:   CLOUD

No cloud resources found in inventory.

Possible reasons:
  - Cloud connectors not configured in SentinelOne
  - No cloud workloads are monitored
  - Service User token may lack cloud inventory access

Suggestions:
  - Check SentinelOne Console > Cloud Security for connector status
  - Try a different surface: /asset-inventory --surface ENDPOINT
================================================================
```

## Error Handling

### MCP Connection Error

```
Error: Unable to connect to SentinelOne Purple MCP server

Token must be Account or Site level (NOT Global).
```

### Authentication Error

```
Error: 401 Unauthorized

### Timeout on Large Inventory

```
Warning: Inventory query timed out.

Partial results available for 500 of ~847 endpoints.
For large environments, the inventory may take multiple queries.

Suggestions:
  - Results shown above are partial
  - Retry to collect remaining data
  - Filter by specific client if needed
```
