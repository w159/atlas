# Rootly MCP Tools & API Patterns

## Overview

Rootly exposes a hosted MCP server at `mcp.rootly.com` built with FastMCP. When accessed through the MCP Gateway, credentials are injected automatically via the `Authorization: Bearer` header — no manual token handling is required. The MCP server generates its 25 tools dynamically from Rootly's OpenAPI specification and exposes a curated subset of the full REST API.

The Rootly REST API follows the **JSON:API specification** (`application/vnd.api+json`), using page-number-based pagination and relationship includes.

## Authentication

### Token Types

| Token Type | Scope | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Global Token** | Full organization access | Recommended for MCP gateway integration |
| **Team Token** | Team-owned resources only | On-call schedules, team escalation policies |
| **User Token** | Inherits user's Rootly permissions | Individual integrations |

For the MCP Gateway, use a **Global Token** to ensure all incident management tools work without permission errors.

**Generate:** Rootly web UI → Account → Manage API Keys → Generate New API Key

### How the Gateway Injects Credentials

When using Rootly through the MCP Gateway, the API token is stored as an org credential and automatically forwarded as:

```
Authorization: Bearer <org-api-token>
```

No additional configuration is needed in the MCP tool calls.

## JSON:API Pagination

Rootly's REST API uses **page-number-based pagination** following the JSON:API spec:

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `page[number]` | Page number (1-indexed) | 1 |
| `page[size]` | Results per page | 25 |

### Pagination Pattern

1. Call the list tool with `page[number]=1`, `page[size]=50`
2. Check the response `meta.total_count` to determine total records
3. Increment `page[number]` until you have all records:
   - `total_pages = ceil(total_count / page_size)`
4. Continue fetching until `page[number] > total_pages`

**Example: Fetch all open incidents:**
- Call `incidents_get` with `page[number]=1`, `page[size]=50`
- Check `meta.total_count`; if 120 total, you need 3 pages (50 + 50 + 20)
- Repeat with `page[number]=2` and `page[number]=3`

### Response Structure (JSON:API)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "abc-123",
      "type": "incidents",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "API gateway latency spike",
        "status": "in_triage",
        "sequential_id": 342
      },
      "relationships": {
        "severity": { "data": { "id": "sev-id", "type": "severities" } },
        "services": { "data": [{ "id": "svc-id", "type": "services" }] }
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total_count": 120,
    "total_pages": 3,
    "current_page": 1
  }
}
```

## Common Query Patterns

### Filter Active Incidents by Status

Call `incidents_get` with `status=in_triage` or `status=detected` to find open incidents.

### Filter by Severity

Call `incidents_get` with `severity=critical` (use the slug from `severities_get`) to focus on the highest-priority incidents.

### Lookup IDs Before Creating Resources

Rootly uses UUIDs for all resource IDs. Before creating an incident, always:
1. Call `severities_get` → use the matching severity's `id`
2. Call `services_get` → use the affected service's `id`
3. Call `teams_get` → use the responding team's `id`

### Discover Endpoints Dynamically

Call `list_endpoints` to get the current full list of available API endpoints. This is useful when the MCP server has been updated to expose new Rootly API endpoints.

## Rate Limiting

Rootly applies rate limits at the API level. The MCP server does not expose rate limit headers, but:

- Avoid fetching all records in rapid succession for large datasets
- Use `page[size]` to limit response sizes (max 100 per page)
- If you receive a 429, wait 30-60 seconds before retrying
- Prefer filtering server-side to reduce total API calls

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | HTTP Code | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Invalid API token | 401 | Token missing or expired | Regenerate at Account > Manage API Keys |
| Insufficient permissions | 403 | Team-scoped token used for org-wide resource | Use a Global token for MCP gateway integration |
| Resource not found | 404 | Invalid ID or resource deleted | Call the list tool to verify the resource exists |
| Validation failed | 422 | Missing required field or invalid ID | Check required parameters; call lookup tools for valid IDs |
| Rate limited | 429 | Too many requests | Back off 30-60 seconds; retry |
| Server error | 500 | Rootly API issue | Retry once; check Rootly status page |

## Best Practices

1. **Use `list_endpoints` to discover tools** — The MCP server generates tools dynamically; new endpoints appear automatically after Rootly API updates
2. **Look up IDs, don't guess** — Always call `severities_get`, `services_get`, and `teams_get` before creating incidents
3. **Paginate large datasets** — Set `page[size]=50` and iterate pages rather than fetching all at once
4. **Use AI tools first** — `find_related_incidents` and `suggest_solutions` often resolve incidents faster than manual investigation
5. **Filter server-side** — Use status and severity parameters in `incidents_get` rather than fetching all and filtering locally
6. **Use Global tokens in the gateway** — Team tokens will cause 403 errors for cross-team incident queries
