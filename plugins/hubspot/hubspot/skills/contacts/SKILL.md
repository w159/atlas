# HubSpot Contact Management

## Overview

Contacts in HubSpot represent individual people -- clients, prospects, vendors, or any person your MSP interacts with. Contacts are the foundational entity in HubSpot CRM. They can be associated with companies, deals, tickets, and activities to build a complete picture of every relationship. For MSPs, contacts typically represent client employees, decision-makers, technical contacts, and billing contacts at managed companies.

```json
{
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "email",
          "operator": "CONTAINS_TOKEN",
          "value": "acmecorp.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100
}
```

**Search by name:**

```json
{

    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "firstname",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "John"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "lastname",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "Smith"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Search by lifecycle stage (find all customers):**

```json
{
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "lifecyclestage",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "customer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "sorts": [
    {
      "propertyName": "lastname",
      "direction": "ASCENDING"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Create a Contact

Call `hubspot_create_contact` with the contact's properties:

**Example: Create a new client contact:**
- `email`: `jane.doe@acmecorp.com`
- `firstname`: `Jane`
- `lastname`: `Doe`
- `phone`: `555-987-6543`
- `company`: `Acme Corporation`
- `jobtitle`: `IT Director`
- `lifecyclestage`: `customer`

### Update a Contact

Call `hubspot_update_contact` with the `contactId` and the properties to change:

**Example: Update lifecycle stage and lead status:**
- `contactId`: `12345`
- `lifecyclestage`: `customer`
- `hs_lead_status`: `CONNECTED`

### Retrieve a Contact

Call `hubspot_retrieve_contact` with the `contactId`:

**Example:**
- `hubspot_retrieve_contact` with `contactId=12345`

## Key Concepts

### Lifecycle Stages

Lifecycle stages track where a contact is in your MSP's sales and service process:

| Stage | Description | MSP Context |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `subscriber` | Signed up for updates | Newsletter subscriber |
| `lead` | Expressed interest | Downloaded a whitepaper or filled out a form |
| `marketingqualifiedlead` | Marketing qualified | Meets marketing criteria for outreach |
| `salesqualifiedlead` | Sales qualified | Confirmed interest in MSP services |
| `opportunity` | Active opportunity | In an active sales conversation |
| `customer` | Paying customer | Signed MSP agreement, receiving services |
| `evangelist` | Advocate | Actively refers new business |
| `other` | Custom stage | Does not fit standard stages |

### Lead Status

Lead status tracks the disposition of sales outreach:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NEW` | New lead, not yet contacted |
| `OPEN` | Open lead, in active outreach |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Engaged in conversation |
| `OPEN_DEAL` | Deal created, in pipeline |
| `UNQUALIFIED` | Does not meet qualification criteria |
| `ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT` | Outreach attempted, no response |
| `CONNECTED` | Connected, conversation initiated |
| `BAD_TIMING` | Interested but not ready |

### Contact Owner

The `hubspot_owner_id` property assigns a contact to a specific user in your HubSpot account. For MSPs, this is typically the account manager or sales rep responsible for the relationship.

1. Call `hubspot_search_contacts` with a filter on `email` using `CONTAINS_TOKEN` with the company's email domain
2. Alternatively, use `hubspot_access_associations` on the company object to get associated contacts
3. For each contact, review role and lifecycle stage

### Create a New Client Contact

2. **Create the contact** - Call `hubspot_create_contact` with email, name, phone, company, job title, and `lifecyclestage=customer`
3. **Associate with company** - Call `hubspot_create_association` to link the contact to the company record
4. **Log onboarding note** - Call `hubspot_create_note` to document the new contact setup

### Update Contact After Sales Conversion

   - `lifecyclestage`: `customer`
   - `hs_lead_status`: `CONNECTED`
2. Call `hubspot_create_note` to log the conversion details
3. Call `hubspot_create_task` to create onboarding follow-up tasks

### Contact Audit for a Client Company

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Contact not found | Invalid contact ID | Verify the ID with `hubspot_search_contacts` |
| Duplicate email | Contact with this email already exists | Search for existing contact first |
| Invalid property | Property name not recognized | Use `hubspot_list_contact_properties` to check available properties |
| Invalid lifecycle stage | Stage value not valid | Use one of: subscriber, lead, marketingqualifiedlead, salesqualifiedlead, opportunity, customer, evangelist, other |
| Rate limited | Too many requests | Wait 10 seconds and retry |

## Best Practices

1. **Always search before creating** - Check for existing contacts by email to avoid duplicates
2. **Use lifecycle stages consistently** - Define clear criteria for each stage in your MSP's process
3. **Associate contacts with companies** - Always link contacts to their company record for full context
4. **Track lead status** - Update lead status as sales conversations progress
5. **Assign owners** - Set `hubspot_owner_id` so team members know who manages each relationship
6. **Log activities** - Create notes and tasks on contacts to maintain a complete activity history
7. **Use email domain search** - Find all contacts at a client by searching for the email domain
8. **Audit regularly** - Review contacts quarterly for stale records and missing information
9. **Standardize job titles** - Use consistent job title formats for better reporting
10. **Respect data privacy** - PHI properties are excluded from MCP responses by design
