# Threat Triage

Triage recent email threats detected by Abnormal Security, prioritized by severity and attack type.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Abnormal Security API token configured (ABNORMAL_API_TOKEN)
- API token must have threat detection read permissions

## Steps

1. **Build search filter**
   - Parse all provided arguments
   - Map text values to API codes (type, severity, status)
   - Construct OData filter expression

2. **Fetch recent threats**
   ```http
   GET /v1/threats?filter=...&pageSize=...
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

3. **Sort by priority**
   - Critical severity first, then High, Medium, Low
   - Within same severity, BEC and supply chain threats first

4. **Format triage report**
   - Display threat list with key details
   - Include severity indicators and recommended actions

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| severity | string | No | - | critical/high/medium/low |
| type | string | No | - | bec/phishing/malware/extortion/scam/spam/supply-chain |
| status | string | No | not-remediated | remediated/not-remediated/post-remediated/all |
| start-date | string | No | 24h ago | ISO 8601 date |
| end-date | string | No | now | ISO 8601 date |
| limit | int | No | 25 | Max results (1-100) |
