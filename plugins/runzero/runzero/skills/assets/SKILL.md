# RunZero Assets

## Overview

RunZero discovers and inventories every asset on the network -- servers, workstations, IoT devices, OT systems, cloud instances, and more. Each asset includes OS fingerprinting, hardware details, network interfaces, open services, and a full attribute history. This skill covers searching, filtering, and inspecting assets.

## Key Concepts

### Asset Types

RunZero classifies assets by type based on fingerprinting:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `server` | Server operating systems |
| `workstation` | Desktop/laptop endpoints |
| `network` | Routers, switches, firewalls |
| `printer` | Network printers and MFPs |
| `iot` | IoT devices (cameras, sensors, etc.) |
| `ot` | Operational technology / ICS |
| `mobile` | Mobile devices |
| `virtual` | Virtual machines and hypervisors |

### OS Fingerprinting

RunZero performs active and passive OS fingerprinting using multiple techniques:

- TCP/IP stack analysis
- Service banner matching
- SNMP sysDescr parsing
- HTTP server headers
- TLS certificate analysis
- MDNS/Bonjour responses

The result is a confidence-weighted OS identification with vendor, product, and version.

### Asset Attributes

Each asset carries a rich set of attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `addresses` | All discovered IP addresses |
| `macs` | MAC addresses |
| `hostnames` | All discovered hostnames |
| `os` | Operating system (fingerprinted) |
| `os_vendor` | OS vendor name |
| `os_version` | OS version string |
| `hw` | Hardware vendor/model |
| `type` | Asset type classification |
| `first_seen` | When the asset was first discovered |
| `last_seen` | When the asset was last seen |
| `alive` | Whether the asset responded to the last scan |
| `site_id` | The site this asset belongs to |
| `tags` | User-assigned tags |

## API Patterns

### List Assets

```
runzero_assets_list
```

Parameters:
- `site_id` -- Filter by site
- `search` -- RunZero query string (e.g., `os:Windows`)
- `count` -- Number of results per page (default 100)
- `offset` -- Pagination offset

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "id": "asset-uuid-123",
      "addresses": ["192.168.1.42"],
      "macs": ["00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"],
      "hostnames": ["ACME-DC01.acme.local"],
      "os": "Windows Server 2022",
      "os_vendor": "Microsoft",
      "type": "server",
      "alive": true,
      "first_seen": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "last_seen": "2026-03-27T08:30:00Z",
      "site_id": "site-uuid-456"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Search Assets

```
runzero_assets_search
```

Parameters:
- `query` -- RunZero query language string

**Example queries:**

```
os:Windows AND type:server
address:10.0.0.0/8 AND alive:true
hostname:DC AND os:Windows Server
type:printer AND last_seen:<30d
NOT os:Windows AND alive:true
```

### Get Asset Details

```
runzero_assets_get
```

Parameters:
- `asset_id` -- The specific asset UUID

Returns full asset details including all attributes, services, network interfaces, and scan history.

### Export Assets

```
runzero_assets_export
```

Parameters:
- `search` -- RunZero query string to filter exports
- `site_id` -- Filter by site

Use the Export API for bulk retrieval of asset data.

## Common Workflows

### Full Asset Inventory

1. Call `runzero_assets_list` for each site
2. Paginate through all results
3. Group by type and OS
4. Generate counts and distribution reports

### Stale Asset Detection

1. Search for assets not seen recently: `alive:false AND last_seen:<30d`
2. Review for decommissioned or offline devices
3. Cross-reference with RMM agent inventory

### OS Distribution Report

1. Export all assets via `runzero_assets_export`
2. Group by `os_vendor` and `os` fields
3. Identify unsupported or end-of-life operating systems
4. Generate per-site breakdown

### Unmanaged Device Detection

1. Export all assets from RunZero
2. Compare against RMM/MDM agent lists
3. Identify assets with no management agent
4. Flag IoT and OT devices for security review

## Error Handling

### Asset Not Found

**Cause:** Invalid asset UUID or asset was merged/removed
**Solution:** Verify the asset ID; search by IP or hostname instead

### Empty Results

**Cause:** Query too restrictive or site has not been scanned
**Solution:** Broaden the query; verify the site has completed scans

## Best Practices

- Use the Export API for datasets larger than a few hundred assets
- Apply site filters to scope queries to specific clients
- Leverage the query language for precise searches
- Monitor `last_seen` to detect assets going offline
- Use `type` filtering to focus on specific device categories
- Cross-reference RunZero assets with PSA configuration items
