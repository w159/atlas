## Common Workflows

### Create Ticket from Alert

1. Receive alert notification
2. Get device and organization context
3. Create ticket with device linked
4. Add alert details to description
5. Set priority based on alert severity
6. Assign to appropriate technician

### Ticket Resolution Flow

1. Update status to IN_PROGRESS
2. Add log entries documenting work
3. Log time entries for billing
4. Update status to RESOLVED
5. Add resolution notes
6. Close ticket

### Escalation Workflow

1. Review ticket age and SLA
2. Update priority if needed
3. Reassign to senior tech
4. Add escalation note
5. Notify stakeholders

## Integration with Devices

Link tickets to devices for context:

```json
{
  "subject": "Outlook crashes repeatedly",
  "deviceId": 12345,
  "description": "User reports Outlook crashes when opening attachments"
}
```

Benefits:
- Quick access to device details
- View device alerts in ticket context
- Run remote actions from ticket

## Tags for Categorization

```json
{
  "tags": [
    "email",
    "outlook",
    "crash",
    "user-reported"
  ]
}
```

Common tag patterns:
- Issue type: `hardware`, `software`, `network`
- Application: `outlook`, `office`, `vpn`
- Source: `user-reported`, `alert`, `scheduled`
- Priority override: `vip`, `urgent`

## Best Practices

1. **Link to devices** - Provides context and quick actions
2. **Use descriptive subjects** - Include who, what, where
3. **Log all work** - Essential for billing and knowledge
4. **Update status promptly** - Keeps queues accurate
5. **Use tags consistently** - Enables better reporting
6. **Document resolution** - Helps with future issues

## Error Handling

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid request | Check required fields |
| 404 | Ticket not found | Verify ticket ID |
| 403 | Access denied | Check organization permissions |
| 422 | Validation error | Review field values |
