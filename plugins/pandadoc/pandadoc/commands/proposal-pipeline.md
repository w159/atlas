# PandaDoc Proposal Pipeline

Summarize the proposal pipeline -- documents grouped by status (draft, sent, viewed, completed, declined, expired), with total values and age metrics. Provides MSP sales pipeline visibility and identifies stale proposals that need attention.

## Prerequisites

- PandaDoc MCP server connected with a valid API key
- MCP tools `pandadoc-list-documents` and `pandadoc-get-document` available

## Steps

1. **Fetch documents by status**

   Make parallel calls to `pandadoc-list-documents` for each pipeline stage:
   - `status=document.draft` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.sent` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.viewed` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.completed` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.declined` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.expired` with `count=100`
   - `status=document.voided` with `count=100`

   Paginate each status if more than 100 results.

2. **Enrich with details** for key documents

   For documents in active stages (sent, viewed), call `pandadoc-get-document` with `id` to get:
   - Grand total (proposal value)
   - Recipient completion status
   - Expiration date

3. **Calculate pipeline metrics**

   - Count documents per status
   - Sum grand totals per status
   - Calculate average age (days since created) per status
   - Identify stale proposals (sent > 7 days, viewed > 3 days without completion)
   - Calculate win rate (completed / (completed + declined + expired))

4. **Identify action items**

   - Drafts older than 7 days (may be forgotten)
   - Sent documents with no views after 3 days
   - Viewed documents not completed after 3 days
   - Documents expiring within 7 days

5. **Format and present** the pipeline summary
