# Huntress Billing & Reports

## Overview

Huntress provides billing and summary reports for MSP partners. Billing reports detail per-organization agent counts for invoicing, while summary reports provide security posture overviews for client-facing communications.

## Key Concepts

### Billing Reports

Billing reports show agent counts per organization for a billing period. Use these for client invoicing and cost reconciliation.

### Summary Reports

Summary reports provide security posture overviews including incidents detected, escalations raised, and overall threat landscape — ideal for client QBRs and monthly security reviews.

## API Patterns

## Common Workflows

### Monthly Billing Reconciliation

1. List billing reports with `huntress_billing_reports_list`
2. Get the current period's report
3. Compare agent counts per organization with expected counts
4. Flag discrepancies for review
5. Generate invoices based on per-org agent counts

### Client Security Summary (QBR)

1. Get summary report for the review period
2. Get billing report for agent counts
3. List incidents filtered by organization
4. Compile per-client security posture summary
5. Present: agents protected, threats detected, incidents resolved

### Cost Analysis

1. Pull billing reports for multiple periods
2. Track agent count trends per organization
3. Identify growing or shrinking clients
4. Forecast billing for upcoming periods

## Error Handling

### Report Not Found

**Cause:** Report for the specified period hasn't been generated yet
**Solution:** Check available reports with the list endpoint first

### No Reports Available

**Cause:** Account is new or billing hasn't been processed yet
**Solution:** Reports are typically generated monthly; wait for the billing cycle

## Best Practices

- Pull billing reports at the start of each month for invoicing
- Use summary reports for client-facing communications
- Track agent count trends for capacity planning
- Cross-reference billing reports with PSA contract terms
- Archive reports for historical trend analysis
- Combine billing and summary reports for comprehensive QBR materials
