# Check Pax8 Subscription Status

View subscription status and details for a specific company. Shows active licenses, seat counts, billing terms, and renewal dates.

## Prerequisites

- Pax8 MCP server connected with a valid MCP token
- MCP tools `pax8-list-companies`, `pax8-list-subscriptions`, `pax8-get-subscription-by-uuid`, and `pax8-get-product-by-uuid` available

## Steps

1. **Resolve company** - Find the company by name or ID

   - If a name was provided, call `pax8-list-companies` with `company_name` set to the search term
   - If a UUID was provided, call `pax8-get-company-by-uuid` with `uuid`

2. **Fetch subscriptions** for the company

   Call `pax8-list-subscriptions` with:
   - `companyId` set to the resolved company UUID
   - `status` set to the requested filter (e.g., `Active`) -- omit if "all" was requested
   - `size=200` for maximum results per page

3. **Enrich with product names** by looking up product details

   For each unique `productId` in the results, call `pax8-get-product-by-uuid` with `productId` to get the product name

4. **Format and return results** with subscription details
