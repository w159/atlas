# Search RocketCyber Incidents

Search security incidents across RocketCyber with filtering by account, status, severity, verdict, and date range.

## Prerequisites

- Valid RocketCyber API key configured (`ROCKETCYBER_API_KEY`)
- User must have read permissions on the provider account

## Steps

1. **Resolve account (if provided)**
   - If account is a number, use as `accountId` directly
   - If account is text, search accounts by name:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api-${ROCKETCYBER_REGION:-us}.rocketcyber.com/v3/accounts" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ROCKETCYBER_API_KEY}" \
     | jq '.data[] | select(.name | test("ACCOUNT_NAME"; "i"))'
   ```
   - If multiple matches, list them and ask the user to specify

2. **Query incidents with filters**
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api-${ROCKETCYBER_REGION:-us}.rocketcyber.com/v3/incidents?accountId={id}&status={status}&severity={severity}&limit={limit}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ROCKETCYBER_API_KEY}"
   ```

   > **Note:** Query parameter names and values should be verified against the API docs. The exact filter syntax (e.g., `status=open` vs `status=New`) may differ.

3. **Apply verdict filter client-side (if needed)**
   - If the API does not support verdict filtering natively, filter results after retrieval
   ```bash
   | jq '[.data[] | select(.verdict == "Malicious")]'
   ```

4. **Format results as a table**
   - Display: ID, Title, Severity, Verdict, Status, Account, Created Date
   - Sort by severity (Critical first) then by creation date (newest first)

## Parameters

| severity | string | No | all | Severity filter: critical, high, medium, low, all |
| verdict | string | No | all | Verdict filter: malicious, suspicious, benign, all |
