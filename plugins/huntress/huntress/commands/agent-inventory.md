## Prerequisites

## Steps

1. **List agents with filters**

   Call `huntress_agents_list` with any specified filters (`organization_id`, `platform`, `status`). Paginate through all results.

2. **Aggregate statistics**

   Compute: total agents, agents by platform, agents by status, agents by organization.

3. **Identify health issues**

   Flag agents that are offline or haven't reported in >24 hours. Identify outdated agent versions.

4. **Build inventory report**

   Present the inventory grouped by organization with status and platform breakdowns.
