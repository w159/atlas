# Look Up HubSpot Company

Find a company in HubSpot CRM by name or domain and display a complete profile including associated contacts, deals, and optionally tickets. Provides a single-view summary of the client relationship.

## Prerequisites

- HubSpot MCP server connected with valid OAuth credentials

## Steps

1. **Search for the company** by name or domain

   - If the query contains a dot (e.g., `acmecorp.com`), search by `domain` using `EQ`
   - Otherwise, search by `name` using `CONTAINS_TOKEN`
   - Call `hubspot_search_companies` with the constructed filter

2. **Retrieve full company details**

   Call `hubspot_retrieve_company` with the matched `companyId` to get all properties.

3. **Fetch associated contacts** (if show_contacts is true)

   - Call `hubspot_access_associations` with `objectType=company`, `objectId=<companyId>`, `toObjectType=contact`
   - For each contact ID, call `hubspot_retrieve_contact` to get name, email, job title, and phone

4. **Fetch associated deals** (if show_deals is true)

   - Call `hubspot_access_associations` with `toObjectType=deal`
   - For each deal ID, call `hubspot_retrieve_deal` to get deal name, amount, stage, and close date

5. **Fetch associated tickets** (if show_tickets is true)

   - Call `hubspot_access_associations` with `toObjectType=ticket`
   - For each ticket ID, call `hubspot_retrieve_ticket` to get subject, status, and priority

6. **Format and present the complete company profile**

Note: Looking up a company with many contacts and deals requires multiple API calls.
For companies with 50+ contacts, this may approach the rate limit.
