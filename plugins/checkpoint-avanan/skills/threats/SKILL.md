# Checkpoint Harmony Email Threat Detection & Analysis

## Overview

Checkpoint Harmony Email & Collaboration (Avanan) uses multiple detection engines to identify email-borne threats before they reach end users. The threat detection system covers phishing, malware, business email compromise (BEC), account takeover (ATO), and zero-day attacks. This skill covers threat types, detection engines, IOC extraction, timeline analysis, and investigation workflows.

## Threat Analysis Workflows

### Phishing Investigation Workflow

1. **Get threat details** - Retrieve full threat record with IOCs
2. **Analyze sender:**
   - Check sender address vs display name mismatch
   - Look up sender domain age and reputation
   - Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC results
3. **Analyze URLs:**
   - Extract all URLs from body and attachments
   - Check URL reputation and redirect chains
   - Identify brand impersonation (login page similarity)
4. **Check scope:**
   - Search for same sender across all recipients
   - Identify how many users received the same campaign
5. **Remediate:**
   - Quarantine all related messages if not already quarantined
   - Add sender domain to block list if confirmed malicious
   - Notify affected users
6. **Document** - Create incident with findings and IOCs

### BEC Investigation Workflow

1. **Review impersonation indicators:**
   - Display name matches executive but email address differs
   - Reply-to address differs from sender
   - Unusual urgency language or financial requests
2. **Check sender authentication:**
   - SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
   - Whether sender domain is a lookalike (typosquatting)
3. **Analyze email content:**
   - Wire transfer or gift card requests
   - Urgency indicators ("immediately", "today", "confidential")
   - Unusual sender behavior patterns
4. **Check for account compromise:**
   - Search for ATO indicators on the impersonated account
   - Review recent login activity and impossible travel
5. **Remediate and report:**
   - Block sender domain
   - Alert targeted recipients
   - Report to incident management

### Malware Analysis Workflow

1. **Get attachment details** - File name, type, size, hashes
2. **Check hash reputation** - Look up SHA-256 in threat intelligence
3. **Review sandbox results** - Dynamic analysis behavior indicators
4. **Extract IOCs:**
   - C2 server addresses
   - Dropped file hashes
   - Registry modifications
   - Network connections
5. **Assess blast radius:**
   - How many users received the attachment
   - Whether any users opened/executed it
6. **Remediate:**
   - Quarantine all instances
   - Block file hash at endpoint level
   - Block C2 domains/IPs at firewall

## Severity Assessment Matrix

| Factor | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|--------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Recipients | 1 user | 2-10 users | 10-50 users | 50+ users or executives |
| Threat Type | SPAM, BULK | DLP, ANOMALY | PHISHING, BEC | MALWARE, RANSOMWARE, ATO |
| Confidence | < 50% | 50-75% | 75-90% | > 90% |
| User Interaction | None | Email opened | Link clicked | Attachment executed |
| Data Exposure | None | Metadata only | Credentials entered | Data exfiltrated |

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid threat type | Use valid type codes from reference above |
| 400 | Invalid date range | Max 90-day range, startDate before endDate |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API credentials and token expiry |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | API key needs threat detection scope |
| 404 | Threat not found | Verify threat ID exists |
| 429 | Rate limited | Implement exponential backoff |

### Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Invalid severity filter | Unrecognized severity value | Use CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW |
| Too many IOC types | Requested more than supported | Use valid iocTypes: urls, domains, fileHashes, ipAddresses |
| Threat expired | Older than retention period | Data no longer available |

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize by severity** - Critical threats first, then high, then medium
2. **Check blast radius early** - Know how many users are affected before deep analysis
3. **Extract and share IOCs** - Feed IOCs to other security tools (SIEM, firewall, EDR)
4. **Correlate across threat types** - A phishing campaign may precede an ATO
5. **Document investigation steps** - Maintains chain of evidence for incident response
6. **Review false positive rates** - High FP rates indicate policy tuning needed
7. **Monitor threat trends** - Track threat volume by type over time for reporting
8. **Never release malware to users** - Even if they insist; escalate to management
