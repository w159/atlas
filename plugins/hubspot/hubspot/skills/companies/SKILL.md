# HubSpot Company Management

## Overview

Companies in HubSpot represent organizations -- MSP clients, prospects, vendors, or partners. Companies are a central entity in the CRM that ties together contacts (the people who work there), deals (sales opportunities), and tickets (support requests). For MSPs, companies typically represent managed clients, each with associated contacts, service agreements, and support history. HubSpot can automatically associate contacts with companies based on email domain matching.

```json
{
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "name",
          "operator": "CONTAINS_TOKEN",
          "value": "Acme"

```json
{

    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "domain",
          "operator": "EQ",

      "direction": "ASCENDING"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100

```

**Search by lifecycle stage (find all customers):**

```json
{
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "lifecyclestage",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "customer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Create a Company

Call `hubspot_create_company` with the company's properties:

**Example: Create a new managed client:**
- `name`: `Acme Corporation`
- `domain`: `acmecorp.com`
- `industry`: `INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_AND_SERVICES`
- `phone`: `555-123-4567`
- `city`: `Springfield`
- `state`: `Illinois`
- `country`: `United States`
- `numberofemployees`: `150`
- `annualrevenue`: `25000000`
- `lifecyclestage`: `customer`

### Update a Company

Call `hubspot_update_company` with the `companyId` and the properties to change:

**Example: Update lifecycle stage and employee count:**
- `companyId`: `98765`
- `lifecyclestage`: `customer`
- `numberofemployees`: `175`

### Retrieve a Company

Call `hubspot_retrieve_company` with the `companyId`:

**Example:**
- `hubspot_retrieve_company` with `companyId=98765`

## Key Concepts

### Company vs. Contact

In HubSpot's model:

- **Company** - The organization (e.g., "Acme Corporation")
- **Contact** - Individual people at the organization (e.g., "John Smith, IT Director")

A company can have many contacts. HubSpot automatically associates contacts with companies based on email domain (e.g., anyone with `@acmecorp.com` is associated with the company that has `domain=acmecorp.com`).

### Company Lifecycle Stages

Companies share lifecycle stages with contacts:

| Stage | Description | MSP Context |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `subscriber` | Signed up for updates | Company on mailing list |
| `lead` | Expressed interest | Requested an MSP consultation |
| `marketingqualifiedlead` | Marketing qualified | Meets ideal client profile |
| `salesqualifiedlead` | Sales qualified | Budget, authority, need confirmed |
| `opportunity` | Active opportunity | Proposal sent or in negotiation |
| `customer` | Paying customer | Under managed services agreement |
| `evangelist` | Advocate | Actively refers new business |
| `other` | Custom stage | Does not fit standard stages |

### Domain-Based Deduplication

HubSpot uses the `domain` property to prevent duplicate company records. When creating a company, always set the domain -- HubSpot will warn if a company with that domain already exists.

## Common Workflows

### Find a Company by Name or Domain

2. Review the results and note the `id` for further operations
3. If not found by name, try searching by domain

### Create a New Managed Client

1. **Check for duplicates** - Search by domain first using `hubspot_search_companies`
2. **Create the company** - Call `hubspot_create_company` with name, domain, industry, address, employee count, and `lifecyclestage=customer`
3. **Create contacts** - Add the primary contact using `hubspot_create_contact`
4. **Associate contacts** - Call `hubspot_create_association` to link contacts to the company

### Company Audit Report

1. Call `hubspot_search_companies` with `lifecyclestage=customer` and `limit=100`
2. Paginate through all results using the `after` cursor
3. For each company, call `hubspot_access_associations` to get associated contacts and deals
4. Build a report with company name, domain, industry, employee count, contact count, open deal count, and last activity date
5. Flag companies with no contacts, no recent activity, or missing domain

### Look Up Company with Associated Records

1. Search for the company by name or domain
2. Call `hubspot_access_associations` with `objectType=company`, `objectId=<companyId>`, `toObjectType=contact` to get contacts

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Company not found | Invalid company ID | Verify the ID with `hubspot_search_companies` |
| Duplicate domain | Company with this domain already exists | Search by domain first to find the existing record |
| Invalid property | Property name not recognized | Use `hubspot_list_company_properties` to check available properties |
| Invalid industry | Industry value not valid | Use `hubspot_list_company_properties` to see allowed industry values |
| Rate limited | Too many requests | Wait 10 seconds and retry |

## Best Practices

1. **Always set domain** - The domain field enables automatic contact-company association and deduplication
2. **Search before creating** - Check by domain to avoid duplicate company records
3. **Use lifecycle stages** - Track companies through your MSP's sales pipeline
4. **Set industry** - Categorize companies by industry for better segmentation and reporting
5. **Assign owners** - Set `hubspot_owner_id` to assign an account manager to each client
6. **Track employee count and revenue** - Keep these fields updated for client sizing and prioritization
7. **Associate all contacts** - Ensure every contact at a client company is linked to the company record
8. **Audit quarterly** - Review company records for completeness and accuracy
9. **Use company type** - Set the `type` field (Prospect, Partner, Vendor, etc.) for clear categorization
10. **Standardize naming** - Use consistent company naming conventions across HubSpot and your PSA
