# View Phishing Campaign Results

Retrieve and display phishing simulation results and click rates from KnowBe4.

## Prerequisites

- Valid KnowBe4 API key configured
- API token with Reporting permissions
- Correct KNOWBE4_REGION set

## Steps

1. **Determine scope**
   - If campaign ID/name provided, fetch that specific campaign
   - If period provided, fetch all campaigns within that date range
   - If neither, default to most recent completed campaign

2. **Retrieve campaign data**
   - Use `knowbe4_phishing_list_campaigns` to find campaigns
   - Use `knowbe4_phishing_get_campaign` for specific campaign details

3. **Get security test results**
   - Use `knowbe4_phishing_list_security_tests` for each campaign
   - Use `knowbe4_phishing_get_security_test` for detailed counts

4. **Filter by group if specified**
   - Cross-reference recipients with group membership
   - Calculate group-specific metrics

5. **Calculate metrics**
   - Phish-prone percentage (PPP)
   - Click rate, open rate, report rate
   - Data entry rate (most critical failure)

6. **Format and display results**
   - Summary view: campaign name, PPP, key counts

   - Recipients view: individual user results
