      heroSummary="Fireflies.ai and Minutes overlap around meeting capture and AI recall, but they are optimized for different jobs. Fireflies.ai is stronger if you want a hosted meeting assistant with integrations, team workflows, and centralized admin. Minutes is stronger if you want local-first meeting memory, inspectable markdown, and agent workflows that live beyond one hosted product."
      quickVerdictCompetitor="you want a hosted meeting assistant with stronger integrations, team workflows, admin controls, and a SaaS collaboration story."
      quickVerdictMinutes="you want local processing, open output, and a memory layer that Claude, Codex, and other MCP clients can query across files and tools."

        "For buyers who want centralized transcripts and meeting workflows without caring about local files or CLI surfaces, Fireflies.ai will usually feel simpler.",
      ]}
      minutesWins={[
        "Minutes is local-first and open-source, so the durable output is inspectable markdown you can keep and use outside the product.",
        "Minutes is stronger for developer and agent-heavy workflows because the product spans MCP, CLI, desktop, SDK, and Claude Code plugin surfaces.",
        "Minutes is better if your core problem is long-lived memory and recall across tools rather than primarily hosted transcript and workflow automation.",
      ]}
      workflowSection={[
        "Fireflies.ai now has real MCP surfaces, including an MCP server for meeting data and a docs MCP server. So the comparison is not 'Fireflies.ai is SaaS and Minutes is MCP.' The more honest distinction is what the system is optimized around. Fireflies.ai is centered on hosted meeting-assistant workflows, integrations, and team operations. Minutes uses MCP as one surface of a broader local-first memory system.",
        "If your team wants a managed meeting assistant that plugs into the rest of your SaaS stack, Fireflies.ai is often the better fit. If you want durable local artifacts and a workflow your own assistants can use across files, desktop, CLI, plugin, and MCP, Minutes is the better fit.",
