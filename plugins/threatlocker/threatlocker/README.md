# ThreatLocker Plugin

Claude Code plugin for the ThreatLocker zero-trust endpoint protection platform.

## Overview

This plugin provides Claude with deep knowledge of ThreatLocker, enabling MSP analysts to triage approval requests, investigate audit logs, and report on managed computer fleets without leaving the chat.

## What It Does

- **Approval Request Triage** - Surface pending application approval requests, group by app/computer, and recommend approve/deny with reasoning based on signer, file hash, and request justification
- **Audit Log Investigation** - Search the ThreatLocker audit trail for blocked actions, policy bypasses, and repeated denials around a security event, and assemble timelines
- **Computer Inventory** - Generate fleet reports across organizations - by OS, by group, by check-in recency
- **Computer Groups** - Browse and pivot through ThreatLocker computer groups to scope policies and reports
- **Multi-Tenant Pivot** - Enumerate child organizations and surface their pending approvals and audit volume in a single view for MSP analysts

## Installation

Install via the [MSP Claude Plugins marketplace](https://github.com/wyre-technology/msp-claude-plugins):
