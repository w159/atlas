# TimeZest Plugin

Claude Code plugin for [TimeZest](https://timezest.com) - PSA-coupled customer scheduling for MSP technicians.

## What It Does

- **Book a tech against a PSA ticket** - Create a TimeZest scheduling request that links to a ConnectWise / Autotask / Halo ticket so the customer can self-serve their slot
- **Track scheduling requests** - Sent / clicked / booked / canceled lifecycle visibility
- **Manage agents, teams, appointment types** - Resolve the right tech and the right kind of appointment for a given ticket
- **Cancel pending bookings** - Revoke an outstanding customer link
