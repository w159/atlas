# Create Pax8 Order

Place an order for a cloud product subscription on behalf of a client company. This provisions new licenses through the Pax8 marketplace.

## Prerequisites

- Pax8 MCP server connected with a valid MCP token
- MCP tools `pax8-list-companies`, `pax8-list-products`, `pax8-get-product-by-uuid`, and `pax8-get-product-pricing-by-uuid` available
- Company must exist in Pax8
- Product must be active and available for ordering
- Quantity must be within the product's min/max range

**Note:** Order creation is done through the Pax8 portal or direct API. The MCP tools support looking up all the information needed to prepare and validate an order.

## Steps

1. **Resolve company** - Find the company by name or use the provided UUID

   - If a name was provided, call `pax8-list-companies` with `company_name` set to the search term
   - If a UUID was provided, call `pax8-get-company-by-uuid` with `uuid`

2. **Resolve product** - Find the product by name or use the provided UUID

   - If a name was provided, call `pax8-list-products` with `search` set to the product name
   - If a UUID was provided, call `pax8-get-product-by-uuid` with `productId`

3. **Validate order** - Check product availability, quantity limits, and billing term

   Call `pax8-get-product-by-uuid` with the resolved `productId` to verify:
   - `active` is `true`
   - `quantity` is within `minQuantity` and `maxQuantity`
   - Requested billing term is in `billingTermOptions`

4. **Get pricing** for confirmation

   Call `pax8-get-product-pricing-by-uuid` with `productId` to show the user:
   - `partnerBuyPrice` (MSP cost)
   - `suggestedRetailPrice` (recommended client price)
   - Monthly and annual cost calculations

5. **Present order summary** for user confirmation before placing

6. **Place the order** through the Pax8 portal or API with the validated details

7. **Verify order status** by calling `pax8-list-orders` with `companyId` to confirm the order was created
