# Xero Invoices Management

## Overview

Invoices are the core transaction entity in Xero for billing and accounts payable. For MSPs, invoices represent two primary flows: sales invoices (ACCREC) for billing managed services clients, and supplier bills (ACCPAY) for vendor costs like software licenses, hardware purchases, and ISP charges.

## Core Concepts

### Invoice Types

| Type | Code | Description | MSP Use Case |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Sales Invoice | `ACCREC` | Accounts Receivable - you bill a customer | Monthly managed services, project work |
| Supplier Bill | `ACCPAY` | Accounts Payable - a vendor bills you | Software licenses, hardware, ISP bills |

### Invoice Status Lifecycle

```
DRAFT --> SUBMITTED --> AUTHORISED --> PAID
                                  \--> VOIDED
                                  \--> DELETED (draft only)
```

| Status | Description | Editable | Can Pay |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `DRAFT` | Created but not submitted | Yes | No |
| `SUBMITTED` | Submitted for approval | Limited | No |
| `AUTHORISED` | Approved and sent to client | No | Yes |
| `PAID` | Fully paid | No | N/A |
| `VOIDED` | Cancelled/voided | No | No |
| `DELETED` | Removed (draft only) | N/A | N/A |

### Invoice Numbering

Xero auto-generates sequential invoice numbers (e.g., INV-0001, INV-0002) or you can set custom numbers using the `InvoiceNumber` field. MSPs often use prefixes like `MS-` for managed services or `PJ-` for project invoices.

## Field Reference

      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Common Workflows

### Monthly MSP Billing Cycle

The typical MSP monthly billing workflow:

1. **Generate invoices** for all managed services clients (1st of the month)
2. **Review drafts** for accuracy
3. **Authorize invoices** to finalize
4. **Email invoices** to clients
5. **Track payments** as they arrive
6. **Follow up** on overdue invoices

```javascript
async function generateMonthlyInvoices(clients, billingMonth) {
  const invoices = clients.map(client => ({
    Type: 'ACCREC',
    Contact: { ContactID: client.xeroContactId },
    Date: `${billingMonth}-01T00:00:00`,
    DueDate: `${billingMonth}-28T00:00:00`,
    Reference: `${billingMonth} Managed Services`,
    LineAmountTypes: 'Exclusive',
    LineItems: client.services.map(service => ({
      Description: `${service.name} - ${billingMonth}`,
      Quantity: service.quantity,
      UnitAmount: service.unitPrice,
      AccountCode: service.accountCode || '200'
    })),
    Status: 'DRAFT'
  }));

  const token = await auth.getToken();
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices?summarizeErrors=false',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'xero-tenant-id': process.env.XERO_TENANT_ID,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ Invoices: invoices })
    }
  );

  return await response.json();
}
```

### Invoice with Tracking Categories

Use tracking categories for department or project reporting:

```json
{
  "Type": "ACCREC",
  "Contact": { "ContactID": "abc-123" },
  "LineItems": [
    {
      "Description": "Managed Services - March 2026",
      "Quantity": 1,
      "UnitAmount": 2500.00,
      "AccountCode": "200",
      "Tracking": [
        {
          "Name": "Department",
          "Option": "Managed Services"
        },
        {
          "Name": "Region",
          "Option": "East"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Credit Note for Service Adjustment

When a client needs a partial credit:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/CreditNotes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "xero-tenant-id: ${XERO_TENANT_ID}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Type": "ACCRECCREDIT",
    "Contact": { "ContactID": "'${CONTACT_ID}'" },
    "Date": "2026-03-15T00:00:00",
    "LineItems": [
      {
        "Description": "Service credit - 3 day outage adjustment",
        "Quantity": 1,
        "UnitAmount": 250.00,
        "AccountCode": "200"
      }
    ],
    "Status": "AUTHORISED"
  }'
```

### Find Unbilled Clients

```javascript
async function findUnbilledClients(billingMonth) {
  const allContacts = await fetchActiveCustomers();
  const invoices = await fetchInvoicesByDateRange(
    `${billingMonth}-01`,
    `${billingMonth}-28`
  );

  const billedContactIds = new Set(
    invoices
      .filter(inv => inv.Type === 'ACCREC')
      .map(inv => inv.Contact.ContactID)
  );

  return allContacts.filter(
    contact => !billedContactIds.has(contact.ContactID)
  );
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Account code is not valid | Verify AccountCode exists in chart of accounts |
| 400 | A Contact is required | Provide Contact with valid ContactID |
| 400 | At least one line item is required | Add LineItems array with entries |
| 400 | Invoice number already used | Use unique InvoiceNumber or omit for auto |
| 400 | Cannot void a paid invoice | Reverse payment first, then void |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Refresh access token |
| 404 | Invoice not found | Verify InvoiceID |

### Validation Errors

Xero returns validation errors inline with the invoice object:

```json
{
  "Invoices": [
    {
      "InvoiceID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "HasErrors": true,
      "ValidationErrors": [
        { "Message": "Account code '999' is not a valid code for this document." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Recovery Pattern

```javascript
async function safeCreateInvoice(invoiceData) {
  const result = await createInvoice(invoiceData);
  const invoice = result.Invoices?.[0];

  if (invoice?.HasErrors) {
    const errors = invoice.ValidationErrors.map(e => e.Message);
    console.error('Invoice validation failed:', errors);

    // Common recovery: invalid account code
    if (errors.some(e => e.includes('Account code'))) {
      console.log('Check chart of accounts for valid codes.');
    }

    // Common recovery: duplicate invoice number
    if (errors.some(e => e.includes('already used'))) {
      delete invoiceData.InvoiceNumber;
      return await createInvoice(invoiceData);
    }

    throw new Error(`Validation errors: ${errors.join('; ')}`);
  }

  return invoice;
}
```

## Endpoint Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/Invoices` | GET | List invoices (paginated, filterable) |
| `/Invoices` | POST | Create or update invoices (single or batch) |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}` | GET | Get single invoice with full detail |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}` | POST | Update an invoice |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}/Attachments` | GET | List invoice attachments |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}/Attachments/{FileName}` | PUT | Upload attachment |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}/OnlineInvoice` | GET | Get online invoice URL |
| `/Invoices/{InvoiceID}/Email` | POST | Email invoice to contact |

## Best Practices

1. **Use DRAFT status initially** - Review before authorizing to prevent errors
2. **Batch create monthly invoices** - Use batch endpoint to reduce API calls
3. **Set meaningful references** - Include month/year and service description
4. **Use consistent account codes** - Map MSP service categories to GL accounts
5. **Include line item detail** - Break out services, licenses, and add-ons separately
6. **Track by department** - Use tracking categories for service line reporting
7. **Void instead of delete** - Maintain audit trail for authorized invoices
8. **Use summarizeErrors=false** - Get per-invoice error details in batch operations
9. **Verify contacts exist** - Check ContactID before creating invoices
10. **Automate recurring billing** - Build monthly generation scripts for consistency
